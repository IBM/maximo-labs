Select Assets Click the Grant listed options for the application Enable options for asset actions Click Save Group . Go back to Health application and login using the user to ensure the operation is now possible. Setup Default Health Asset Condition Scores Maximo Health v9 includes the ability to automatically active Asset Condition scoring for all assets that don't belong to a score group. After you activate the default asset condition scores, any new asset you create will also use the out of the box default score group to calculate asset condition for Health Risk and Criticality. Asset that are already part of score group will be skipped. Watch the video on Default Asset Condition Scores Activate the Default Score In this exercise you enable the Default Score . After you Log into IBM Maximo for the first time you will be reminded to enable the Default Score . Press the Activate Button to enable the Default Scores. Make sure you have create assets and they have the required dependencies set. An Asset Priority, Work orders or Service Requests set against the asset. Asset installation date and asset expected life based on Manufacture. Optionally you can choose to activate the scores later . Go to Setting Group and Groups tab to find the Default_Score group to enable it. Check the group to see if the default scores have been activated. You will see Health, Risk and Criticality calculated for all your assets. Asset scores will begin to be calculated using the Default_Score group. You can also verify if the scoring is working by viewing assets using the Asset Table List page. If the Health, Risk ad Criticality score don't apper it likely because there data missing for it to be calculated. You can bulk update missing data for Installation Date in the Asset Table List page simply by clicking on the column and row asset value and entering the information in the pop up dialog. You can also view the Asset Condition Scores for Health , Risk and Criticality on the Asset Details page. Create an Asset In this exercise you create an asset in IBM Maximo Manage. You will use this asset later to measure it's Meantime Between Failure and see how it's value performs versus other assets using a Chart. In order for the Meantime Between Failure Score to be calculated you also are required also create an unscheduled emergency work order. Let's start by first creating the asset and then a work order. To create an example asset for Meantime Between Failure score make sure you enter the following asset fields: Asset Number: \"AH016\" Description: \"Submersible pump 20 hp rotary\" Asset Type: \"Pump\" Status: Active Installation Date: 6/1/20 Expected Life: 10 ( Manufacture suggested life - 20% for example) Vendor: Armstrong Manufacturer: Armstrong Log into IBM Maximo.

Set the Capex to 1350000 . Click Create . Click Run Analysis . Meantime Between Failure To calculate the count of how many assets are achieving or not achieving the meantime to failure requires that you specify threshold goal to achieve. For example what is the number of hours an asset needs to go to achieve the meantime of failure goal. Assets who have a meantime between failure less than the number of hours means they are failing earlier than required and therefore aren't meeting the meantime between failure. Meantime between failures is calculated using the amount of time an asset goes before it has an unscheduled work order. Where the work order is either a corrective maintenance or emergency maintenance. The meantime between failure is calculated by summing the total amount of time between installation and the first and subsequent unscheduled work order divided by the total number of unscheduled worker order occurrences. Create Threshold on Charts Page To create a meantime between failure threshold consider the group of assets that you are measuring performance for. Consider creating separate thresholds for a groups of similar expected performance assets within an asset class like pumps and other thresholds for assets that are part of a system and require similar performance considerations like an HVAC system. For this exercise you will create a MTBF performance threshold for an asset class. You can use pumps that have a similar asset class, type, manufacture and model. There are two ways to create Thresholds . One is on the Asset Charts page, If you haven't previously created any Thresholds . The other way to create them by going to the Score Settings page. Navigate to the Asset Charts page. Click Create threshold button. Fill in the form values and click the Save button. Select the box at the top of the page to select all of the assets on the table. Select Create investment project . Create Threshold on Score Settings Page Create a Threshold anytime by navigating to the Score Settings After you create the threshold it will be made available as an option on MTBF chart on the Charts page. Navigate to the Score Setting page. Click Funnel button. Select the previously created Threshold you want to use for the current View and click the Save button. The other way to create them by going to the Score Settings page. Navigate to the Asset Charts page. Click Create threshold button. Fill in the form values and click the Save button. Select the box at the top of the page to select all of the assets on the table. Select Create investment project . Add Required Data on Asset Details To calculate an asset's meantime between failure (MTBF), the asset's installation date must be known. Assets that are unable to display their MTBF value will show an i icon in the MTBF column and asset row in Asset Table Page or on the value card of the Asset Details Page. By clicking on the i icon, a dialog will open where you can set the installation date. Suggested values for the installation date are also provided. Navigate to an Asset Details Page Click the an i icon on the MTBF value card. Choose the installation date using the Calendar control inf the dialog. If you don't know the installation date consider using the suggested value of when the asset was first added to Maximo. Click save to save the installation date. The MTBF value card will be updated when the MTBF calculation is recalculated in the crontask . Add Required Data on Asset Table Navigate to an Asset Table Page Click the an i icon on the MTBF value card. Choose the installation date using the Calendar control inf the dialog. If you don't know the installation date consider using the suggested value of when the asset was first added to Maximo. Click save button to save the installation date. The MTBF value card will be updated when the MTBF calculation is recalculated in the crontask . You will see a status message letting you know the value will be calculated. Troubleshoot MTBF If an asset's MTBF value doesn't appear in the Asset Details page or Asset Table page after you have entered and the asset's installation date and the crontask has run then check to see if there are any filters applied to the crontask that remove your asset from the list of assets to be calculated for MTBF. Navigate to the crontask in Manage. Search on MTBF and click on the MTBF crontask . Review the crontask parameters to see if the value would descope your asset from being calculated. Remove or correct any filters that my descope your asset from being included in the MTBF score calculation task. and click the save button to save the crontask settings. Summary Congratulations.

Whether you're just starting out with preventive, condition-based, or predictive maintenance, setting up Health scoring is key. Maximo Health takes all your source data and combines them into scores that represent different aspects of your assets' performance. Turning on default Health scores is great if: you want to assess the performance of your assets and don't know where to start you don't have a reliability engineer or subject matter expert (SME) to come up with customized, advanced scoring need time to slowly gather more data and come up with an advanced scoring methodology you are new to using Maximo Health and can benefit from learning how to use the scoring capabilities Tip Even if you have your own scoring methologies, you can still turn on default scores as it will help familiarize yourself with the Health scoring process. It is easy to customize using the default scores, deactivate them at any time, or create your own scores that will overide the default settings. Default Health Scoring FAQs \u2753 Can I setup default Health scores if I'm not using Maximo Manage (old Maximo or another EAM system)? \ud83d\udcac Yes, you can. However, it will be harder to view and fix source data. You will need to integrate your EAM system with IBM App Connect. See tutorial here MAS v9.0 Default Health Scoring Setup Lab We will take you through a step-by-step process of setting up default Health scores in your MAS environment. Lab Contents Setup Requirements Understanding Default Scores Check for Data Quality Customize Default Score Configurations Deactivate Default Scores Activate Default Scores Setup Requirements System Requirements MAS Health with Manage v9.0 is installed, or MAS Health v9.0 standalone is installed with your own EAM Data equirements Work order data Asset installation date and manufacturer's expected life Asset priority Outcome Generate Health, Criticality, and Risk scores for all assets Understanding Default Scores Asset health measures the current condition of your assets. Factors that influence an asset\u2019s health include its age, usage, maintenance history, condition, environment, and safety. The default health score configuration is calculated based on an asset's age, high priority open corrective work orders, and high priority open service requests. Each contributor has equal weights. Remaining Useful Life (RUL) - Weight: 33.33% An asset nearing the very end of its expected lifespan with many high priority requests for corrective work will yield a very low health score. Conversely, a new asset with few high priority requests for corrective work will yield a very high health score. Weighted Count of Open Service Requests - Weight: 33.33% This is a weighted calculation of all your open service requests based on priority in the past 5 years. More frequent and higher priority service requests will negatively affect the health score. Closing more high priority service requests will improve it. Default configuration assumes that service requests have a priority of 1 to 5, where 1 is the lowest priority and 5 is the highest priority Default configuration assumes that 0 is the lowest number of service requests, and 10 is the most number of service requests. Weighted Count of Open Corrective Work orders - Weight: 33.33% This is a similar calculation to OPENSR as it takes a weighted calculation of all open corrective work orders based on priority in th past 5 years. More frequent and higher priority open corrective work orders will negatively affect the health score. Closing more high priority corrective work orders will improve it. Default configuration assumes that work orders have a priority of 1 to 5, where 1 is the lowest priority and 5 is the highest priority Default configuration assumes that 0 is the lowest number of open work orders, and 10 is the most number of open work orders. Criticality indicates the business importance of your assets. In other words, how severe would the customer, financial, and safety impact be if the asset were to fail? The default criticality score is the priority assigned to the asset. Risk measures the probability of high-risk failure. It is usually the likelihood of failure times consequence (Health x Criticality). The default risk score is the product of asset\u2019s risk health and criticality scores. An asset with high business impact (and therefore criticality score) will be at higher risk than an asset with low business impact with the same health conditions. Activate Default Scores Login to Maximo Application Suite (must be v9.0 or above) Click Activate now to turn on automatic defatul scores. This will apply our out-of-the-box configurations to ALL assets in your system and score them on a daily basis. (Note: This will not override any existing scores you have activated. You can also undo this action later.) It might takes several minutes to calculate using default score, depending on the number of assets in your system. When calculation is done, click View Default_scores to navigate to the default scoring group. The Default_scores is a read-only scoring group that contains all assets in your system. It contains the default score configurations for health , criticality , and risk . Click on Health to view the default health score configuration for this group.

Note The default calcuation runs on a cron task every 24 hours. You can tell the scores are activated if the toggle is on and when the next automatic calculation is. Congratulations! You've learned how to activate health, criticality, and risk scores for all assets in your system using default configurations. You can now navigate to the default score group and understand how each default score is calculated. Check for Data Quality This section will help you identify and correct incomplete default scores. A complete health score based on default calculations requires the following asset data: installation date manufacturer's expected life A complete criticality score based on default calculations requires the following asset data: asset priority A complete risk score based on default calculations requires both health and criticality scores to be complete. The following steps will guide you to identify incomplete scores and add missing data. This is an important piece to ensuring quality data. In the Default_scores group, scroll down to the list of all assets. You may notice a different icon denoting \"incomplete\" scores, which means at least one required data is missing. Assets with missing data will still yeild results, but the scores are \"incomplete,\" so they might not be the most accurate. To add missing data for an incomplete score, click on the value of the incomplete score. For incomplete health scores, enter the Installation date and Manufacturer's expected life . Click Update . The asset data will be saved in the asset record in Maximo Manage. For incomplete criticality scores, enter the asset priority . Click Update . The asset data will be saved in the asset record in Maximo Manage. To view the updated score after entering missing data, you can wait for the cron task to run during the next automatic calculation or click calculate to get immediate results. Note If health score has missing required asset data, it will calculate results based on available maintenance data. If criticality score has missing priority, it will assume an asset priority of medium, or 3, to get the score (this is not in kept in the asset record). Customize Default Score Configurations Default scores may not meet your individual requirements, so they are designed to be customizable. In this section, you'll learn how to modify, add, and delete default score configurations to a group of assets. Start with the Default_scores. . Click Duplicate group . This will create a new group using the duplicated defalut score configurations. Give your new group a name and description (in this case it will be a group for Pumps ). Select a query for my assets.

Click on Health score to view the default configuration you've copied. You can now make any modifications, including adding, deleting or modifying a contributor. You can also adjust the contributor weights. To delete a contributor, click the delete icon next the contributor. In this case, delete the OPENSR contributor. The contributor weights no longer add up to 100%. To update, click the edit button Re-assign the weights so that OPENCMWO is 60% and RUL is 40% . Click save . To add a contributor, click the add icon next in the Contributors table. This should open up a window, where you can select from existing contributors. To modify a contributor, click contributor you want to edit. In this case, click OPENCMWO contributor. The contributor is appended with _COPY because it is a duplication of the default read-only contributor. Unlike the default contributor, the contributor copy is editable, including its formula and normalization values. Click on the edit button next to value normalization . Click Continue to acknowledge any edits to the contributor will affect all scores that use it. Specify the normalization values to determine the best and worst possible values for this contributor. Since default OPENCMWO makes some assumptions about your work orders, some adjustments may be needed: Work orders have a priority of 1 to 3, where 1 is the lowest priority and 3 is the highest priority 0 is the lowest number of open work orders, and 25 is the most number of open work orders. Doing the math, the best case scenario is 0x3=3, and the worst case scenario is 3x25=75. Change Worst possible value to 75 . Click save . Go back to Health score in the breadcrumbs to return to the previous page. Click the Activate toggle button. This will override the score configurations in the default group. Go back to Pumps score in the breadcrumbs. Another modification you want to make is to the criticality score. Click on Criticality . Click the priority contributor to edit it. Click the edit button next to value normalization . The default assumes your assets are prioritized on a range of 1 to 5, where 1 is lowest priority and 5 is highest priority. Make changes to the normalization based on this scenario: Assets have a priority of a 1 to 5, where 1 is the highest priority and 5 is the lowest priority. You would modify the normalization so that the Best possible value is 1 and Worst possible value is 5 . Click save . Go back to Criticality score in the breadcrumbs. Make sure to click the Activate toggle button to activate this score configuration. Go back to Pumps score in the breadcrumbs. To remove a score configuration (in this case, we want to remove Risk ), click the delete delete button next to it. Click delete to confirm. You can wait until the next scheduled calculation to generate updated scores. To get udpated scores immediately, click Re-calculate .

Your role is to maintain the reliability of the grid. Your major responsibility is to ensure that the grid stays up and operational. You are also responsible for making short, medium and long term investment decisions that drive maintenance and replacement policies. You use asset condition and operational data to gain insights into Asset Health, Probability of Failure and Risk, both today and into the future. Thankfully you have a Health and Predict solution from IBM with advanced analytics that help you work efficiently and confidently without relying on spreadsheets or point solutions that consider 1 or 2 data sources. Health and Predict incorporates multiple data sources such as Asset Master data from Manage, Work order data, historical failure data, GeoSpatial Data, Inspection and Test Logs, IoT and Sensor data. Health and Predict provides a flexible asset condition framework for mining the asset condition data. Health and Predict helps you identify assets that are at greatest risk of failure, across different circuits/feeders, substations and regions. The risk assessment helps you drive asset and work management activities in Maximo Manage or other EAM systems to keep the grid up, reduce operational expense, optimize and defend capital expenditures resulting in better outcomes. Maximo Health and Predict are applications in Maximo Application Suite (MAS) that are targeted to the reliability engineer, and provide a view of the current state and future state of an enterprise's assets. IBM Maximo Models for Electrical Distribution is an accelerator that extends Health and Predict designed for understanding the condition of electrical distribution asset classes used by the utilities industry. Identify On the \u201cApplications\u201d tab, there are tiles for each of the applications that the admin has loaded from the Maximo Application Suite (MAS). On the \u201cIndustry Solution\u201d tab, there is a tile for Health and Predict \u2013 Utilities. Value Health and Predict arm you the reliability engineer with AI-powered insights to take actions to extend the life of the Utility\u2019s assets, reduce maintenance costs, and eliminate unplanned downtime. Actions Follow the action items below. From the main MAS page, select the Applications tab Click the Launch link Health tile. The Asset Table View is displayed with the default query of all assets. Asset Table View On the main screen, there is a table view of all managed assets in a familiar table view. From this page you can quickly choose the asset query that reflects the assets you are responsible for. You can filter those assets to quickly identify the assets that have poor scores by sorting the assets or by searching for assets using key words so that you can get the latest asset details on an individual asset. Value This is particularly valuable because it shows you a mix of both IT data (from Manage) and OT data (from Monitor) together in a single view. This asset data is coming from Maximo Manage, but MAS can connect to other EAM systems with or App Connect, via API or using Monitor Connectors. Different views of the data can be generated to make it easier to identify critical assets. On this grid, you can add and move columns, filter, search and sort. Actions Follow the action items below. Select the hamburger icon above to the magnifying glass to show the left navigation menus. This shows how you can navigate to other perspectives like locations to understand location health.

Using a map view focused to a container is a good way to understand the capabilities and benefits of the Map view. Containers enable to you reflect the geolocation of your assets and geo fencing of business areas. It could be a region, town, service subscriber area you are responsible for servicing. We\u2019ll look at a region that contains a mixture of transformers, circuit breakers, cables (OTWs), and switches. Select a group of assets, or a container, that contains a mixture of transformers, circuit breakers, cables (OTWs), and switches. Value Seeing how assets are spatially distributed may assist with identifying and investigating assets at risk. This is especially true in the utilities industry that have geo location dependencies on interconnectivity, weather or area of responsibility. Actions Follow the action items below.

Work Queues View Using Work queues view is another way to identify assets in trouble or need your attention so that you can take an action to ensure KPIs are able to be calculated and to avoid asset unplanned downtime and be more proactive in maintenance planning. There are a number of Work queues included with Health and Predict. Here are some example Work queues Predict assets with a High probability of failure Identify Assets in poor health Identify assets with Assets missing data Work queues are preconfigured views designed to help find assets that meet specific conditions. They can be used by the reliability engineer to systematically address each asset on the list, in turn, and \u201cwork down\u201d the list. Value Allows you to prioritize your work and focus to address a specific problem, like a utility, trying to avoid unplanned downtime. Actions Follow the action items below. Hover over the left nav bar to expand it Select the Work queues section on the left nav bar Select Failing Before PM work queue Investigate The Failing before PM work queue shows all of the assets with scores in that work queue. As a reliability engineer at a Utilities plant, it is critical to avoid failures. Note that for this Work queues , there are several pumps and substation transformers that have a predicted failure before their next planned maintenance date. Two of the transformers are in the container that was viewed earlier. You will select ST_1400518 in the queue to start managing your work load for the day by investigating and addressing all of the assets in the work queue. You will use the Asset Details view to better understand the holistic asset condition of ST_1400518 so that you can better assess and pick a corrective action. Value The missing data Work queues are useful for an reliability engineer to help identify gaps in data necessary to create health scores or predictive failure date models. Actions Follow the action items below. Select ST_1400518 which opens the asset details view. Details on this page will vary since this is a live demonstration environment system. Assets Detail View On the top of the Asset Details page there are the resulting scores from the predefined notebook for this substation transformer. These are health, criticality, risk, end of life and effective age score. Note that effective age is a calculation using the actual age and the health score. An asset in poor health will have an effective age greater than its actual age. On the second line, there are custom scores, like the Substation Efficiency score. The next Preventive Maintenance date and the MRR come directly from Maximo Manage. Value The asset detail page is an useful for investigating assets. Asset condition information is presented on a single page, in easy-to-read tables, charts and graphs. On the top of the page, there are details about the asset, and KPIs that give a snapshot of its current state. For this asset, there is a Health Score of 44, which is in the medium fair zone. This asset also has a high Criticality and low Risk Score . This asset has a low percentage of probability that there will be an imminent failure , based on the Installation Date and manufacturers recommended life. The asset is projected to fail in the next 0 days, but the next maintenance isn't planned for 30 days. At the beginning of the investigation, you suspected the asset was going to fail before its planned maintenance. But, just by looking at the KPIs, additional evidence suggests that this asset may be in trouble, and that some action needs to be taken now. The Health history widget of this asset is below the Score widget . Using the historical health chart, you can see this assets health has been low for some time. This is another indication that this asset needs attention. Value Viewing the contributors and the historical health scores can give insight into the why a particular score is trending in one direction or the other. Actions Follow the action items below. Scroll down the page to learn more about the health of the asset, go to the Score details widget. Understand what is contributing to the poor health of the asset to see how you might address the problems. Expand the view to see the contributors by clicking the chevrons to view the contributors to poor asset health. See and sort on complete list of contributors to help understand what might be the root cause of the problem. Click Weight to understand what is contributing the most to the Score From the Scoring drop down box you can also see other Custom score contributors that you have created using the custom score template. The Health application supports asset-specific calculations and visualizations like Dissolved gas analysis for transformers. There a two types of visualization widgets available to understand the transformers gas conditions using inspection or sensor data readings. Value Understanding gas levels can be a early indicator of underlying asset transformer problems that if not inspected or serviced could result in an unscheduled maintenance or failure. Actions Follow the action items below. Scroll down the Asset Details page until you reach the Dissolved gas analysis tile. Click on each of the dots to get detailed information about the amount of those types of gases. Click the switcher icon on the top right corner of the tile, to view the results in the table view. The other widget is the history of combustible gas concentrations. It shows the combustible gas trend and rating over time. The rating represents the average acceptability of detected gas concentrations. The rating is determined by the overall factor. Hover on each of the assessment dates to get the detailed asset condition information. There are several predictive model templates that come with Predict. Your data scientist has trained and deployed these models built using Cloud Pack for Data and Watson Studio which is included with Maximo Application Suite. IBM Predict includes templates to: Predict days to failure Calculate probability of failure Detect anomalies Generate an asset life curve based on group asset deployment and decommission dates These templates include a large number of algorithms and can automatically select the one that best fits the data for the optimal outcome. These models are built to detect specific problems for each asset problem and failure mode. They can detect problems and forecast the future condition of the asset using historical asset sensor data ingested by Maximo Asset Monitor or streamed into Health using the App Connect included with Maximo Application Suite. Value Understanding what potential problems may occur in the future allows you to schedule asset maintenance or replacement without impacting customer service or production. Actions Follow the action items below. Scroll down Asset Details page until you reach the Predictions tile. Double click the \" the Predictions tile tile to expand the tile and see the prediction cards. Note that also included with MAS is Watson Studio and Watson Machine Learning, both of which a Data Scientist can use for building, training, and maintaining predictive models. In the case of this asset, the model tells us that it is projected to fail in 0 days plus or minus 1 day. A Data Scientist can build predictive models for specific failure modes using the templates included with Predict if you have failure history data. The reliability engineer can select those failure modes within the card to see the projection for each failure modes. The failure training data is used to help calculate Failure probability. Different failure modes can be calculated and do impact predictions. Failure probability is the chance that an asset may have a failure with a certain time period. For this asset there is a 20% probability of failure in the next 2 months due to overheating. A Data Scientist must build specific models for time periods just like the failure modes. You can see the prediction results by making different selections within the card. Failure probability history shows how the probability of failure for each mode and how it has changed over time. The Factors that contribute to failure show which factors from the training data impacted failures the most, giving an indication of what may lead to future failures. The anomaly detection model creates a threshold based on history and shows when the asset exceeds that threshold in the card. The End of life curve is built based on training data for assets that have been decommissioned. By applying the effective age calculation from the notebook, this curve can be used to estimate probability of an end of life failure. The Effective age of the transformer is 27 years. The curve produces an end of life probability of 89%. This is one more indication that this asset needs to be attended to immediately. Value Understanding this asset Effective age and End of life curve relative to all the assets, allows you to understand it's likely remaining life given given it's operation and conditional history rather instead of it's calender based age. Actions Follow the action items below. Hover near the point where the Effective age crosses the curve. How is this asset performing relative to others of a similar class and where it should be for it's age? The Asset timeline card shows several pieces of key information about the asset in the same graph. For example, the timeline shows a predicted failure (on the top line of the graph), that will occur before the next preventive maintenance (on the second line of the graph). Value Information on the Asset timeline chart, like past work orders and inspection, provide valuable insight into the asset's history, and may help you better formulate what kind of action to take. Actions Follow the action items below. Scroll down the page Hover over a point on the timeline There are several other sections on this page including: Operational status , showing recent meter readings, maintenance history, showing work orders for this asset. Replacement planning , showing any replacement or refurbishment plans created for this particular asset. Value While each piece of information, or card, gives nsight into the state of our asset, all of the information together, gives a richer view, and helps make a data-driven decision on how to address this asset. Take Action There\u2019s enough evidence from the investigation to take some action against this asset. Scroll to the top of the page and click the Actions dropdown selection box button to see the options. Actions Follow the action items below. Value Corrective actions to address asset problems can be done with a couple of clicks directly from the asset detail page. Scroll to the top of the page. Click the Actions button.

Health and Predict incorporates multiple data sources such as Asset Master data from Manage, Work order data, historical failure data, GeoSpatial Data, Inspection and Test Logs, IoT and Sensor data. Health and Predict provides a flexible asset condition framework for mining the asset condition data. Health and Predict helps you identify assets that are at greatest risk of failure, across different circuits/feeders, substations and regions. The risk assessment helps you drive asset and work management activities in Maximo Manage or other EAM systems to keep the grid up, reduce operational expense, optimize and defend capital expenditures resulting in better outcomes. Maximo Health and Predict are applications in Maximo Application Suite (MAS) that are targeted to the reliability engineer, and provide a view of the current state and future state of an enterprise's assets.

What is a Health score? We need to differentiated a \"Health\" score and a \"health\" score. When referring to a \"Health\" score (capital \"H\"), we are talking about a score from the Maximo Health application. It is a calculated representation of some aspect of your asset. It can be a score that indicates an asset's condition, maintenance health, criticality, risk, sustainability, safety, etc. Generally, we recommend some basic score types to start: Health score Criticality score Risk score Why do I need Health scores? You need to setup scores in Health if you want to use Maximo Application Suite (MAS) to do any of the following: Preventive maintenance Condition-based maintenance Risk-based maintenanece Predictive maintenance By setting up Health scores, you can easily view and analyze your assets' performance. A Health score takes all of an asset\u2019s data from IT and OT sources and represents an aspect of an asset's performance as a number: 0 being very poor performing and 100 being very good performing. Understanding asset scores can help an engineer, maintenance planner, or asset planner better make decisions to reduce unplanned downtime, prevent unnecessary costs, and extend an asset's life: decide what work orders to carry out to prevent expensive unplanned downtime today plan maintenance or replacement to avoid expensive unplanned downtime in the future What data do I need to get started? You only need two things to start using scores in Health: Assets loaded into Maximo Manage/EAM (or use App Connect to load non-Maximo data into MAS) At least some work order data Yes, it is that easy! Maximo Health can also handle more complex data, such as Monitor condition data, historical data, cost and financial data, etc. What basic Health scores do I need? Health, or asset health context Health is an index that is an aggregate score for the health of an asset and is calculated from the historical performance of the asset and the measured physical condition. The higher the value for the asset health index , the less likely the asset will fail. Example factors that are used to calculate the heath index are age, manufacturer, and overload time. Criticality Criticality is business importance of an asset that measures the severity of the customer, financial, and safety impact if the asset were to fail. Criticality can have a combination of factors, a common one being the numbers customers that are supported by an asset. Risk Risk is the risk to the business of a failure in the network. The higher the value for risk , the more risk there is to the business. It is usually a product of an asset's health and criticality . How to read a Health score A Health score is usually presented as a value from 0 to 100. It is a normalized value so that a it can be compared with other assets in a group, site, system, fleet, or organization. Depending on the score type, 100 can be good (ie. indicating perfect asset health) or 100 can be (ie. indicating extremely high risk of failure) Health returns values in the range 0 to 100 where 100 is as new condition and 0 is very poor condition. Criticality is rated from 0 to 100 where 0 is not critical at all and 100 is very critical. Risk is a percentage value given by the product of the values for Health and Criticality , where 0 is lowest risk and 100 is highest risk.
