## Introduction
In this overview task guide you will be Marcia.  She is a Reliability Engineer (RE), whose role is to maintain the 
reliability of the grid.  Her main responsibility is to ensure that the grid stays up and operational.  She is also 
responsible for making short, medium and long term investment decisions that drive maintenance and replacement policies.  
She uses asset condition and operational data to gain insights into Asset Health, Probability of Failure and Risk, both
today and into the future. 

Thankfully, You will have a Health and Predict - Utilities solution from IBM with advanced analytics to help you do your 
work efficiently and confidently without relying on spreadsheets or point solutions that consider 1 or 2 data sources.   
Health and Predict - Utilities incorporates multiple data sources such as Asset Meter and Work order data, historical 
failure data, GeoSpatial Data, Inspection and Test Logs, IoT and Sensor data.   Health and Predict - Utilities provides 
a flexible Asset condition framework for mining the asset condition data. Health and Predict - Utilities helps you 
identify assets that are at the greatest risk of failure, across different circuits/feeders, substations and regions.  
The risk assessment helps you drive asset and work management activities in Maximo Manage or other EAM systems to keep 
the grid up, reduce operational expense, optimize and defend capital expenditures resulting in better outcomes.


Maximo Health and Maximo Predict are targeted to the RE, and provide a view of the current state of an enterprise's 
assets, and projects future conditions of those assets.  HPU is an extension of Health and Predict designed specifically 
for the Utilities industry.  Health, Predict, and HPU share the same User Interface (UI).

##  Identify
<a name="identify"></a>

On the “Applications” tab, there are tiles for each of the applications that the admin has loaded from the Maximo Application Suite (MAS).  On the “Industry Solution” tab, there is a tile for Health and Predict – Utilities.

!!! note "Value"
     Health and Predict - Utilities arm the RE with AI-powered insights to take actions to extend the life of the Utility’s assets, reduce maintenance costs, and eliminate unplanned downtime.

![setup_assets](./img/HPU_8.9/HPU 82.png)

This page shows 3 charts:
- a health wheel categorizing all of the assets by health
- an unplanned downtime view showing hours of downtime by month
- a chart showing failure rate per manufacturer

!!! note "Value"
    Seeing key KPIs for multi-assets by health distribution, categorized by unplanned downtime or failure rate per 
manufacture can help understand assets failure trends.

Drill-down through each of these charts to see the assets details of each category.

For example, clicking on the manufacturer Boggs shows a 100% failure rate.  So all assets from Boggs have failed.

!!! attention "Actions"
    Follow the action items below.

1. Click on the manufacturer `Boggs` to see the failures by that manufacturer
![setup_assets](./img/HPU_8.9/HPU 83.png)
2. Return to the charts page by using the breadcrumb at the top of the page
![setup_assets](./img/HPU_8.9/HPU 84.png)

Using “work queues” is another way to identify assets in trouble, and to take an action to avoid unplanned downtime and 
be more proactive in maintenance planning.

!!! attention "Actions"
    Follow the action items below.

1. Hover over the left nav bar to expand it
2. Select the `Work queues` section on the left nav bar
![setup_assets](./img/HPU_8.9/HPU 85.png)
3. Select `Failing Before PM` work queue
![setup_assets](./img/HPU_8.9/HPU 86.png)

Work queues are preconfigured views designed to help find assets that meet specific conditions.  They can be used by the
reliability engineer to systematically address each asset on the list, in turn, and “work down” the list.

!!! note "Value"
    These are particularly valuable to a RE who needs to address a specific problem, like a utility, trying to avoid 
unplanned downtime.

There are a number of work queues included with Health and Predict.
- There are work queues specific to Predict, like assets with a High Probability of Failure.
- There’s also a work queue for identifying assets in poor health.

And there are work queues that show assets with missing data.

!!! note "Value"
    The missing data work queues are useful for an RE to help identify gaps in data necessary to create health scores or predictive failure models.

The “Failing before PM” work queue shows all of the assets with scores in that work queue.  As a RE at a Utilities plant, it is critical to avoid failures.
- In this work queue, there are several pumps and substation transformers that have a predicted failure before their next planned maintenance date.
- 2 of the transformers are in the container that was viewed earlier.
- Select “ST_1400518” in the queue to start managing the workload for the day, investigating and addressing all of the assets in the queue.

!!! attention "Actions"
    Follow the action items below.

1. Select `ST_1400518` which opens the asset detail page [DETAILS ON THIS PAGE WILL VARY AS THIS IS A LIVE DEMO SYSTEM]
![setup_assets](./img/HPU_8.9/HPU 87.png)

## Investigate
<a name="investigate"></a>

On the top of the asset detail page there are the resulting scores from the predefined notebook for this substation transformer.  These are health, criticality, risk, end of life and effective age score.  Note that effective age is a calculation using the actual age and the health score.  An asset in poor health will have an effective age greater than its actual age.

On the second line, there are custom scores, like the Substation Efficiency score.

![setup_assets](./img/HPU_8.9/HPU 88.png)

The next Preventive Maintenance date and the MRR come directly from Maximo Manage.

!!! note "Value"
    The asset detail page is an useful for investigating assets.  Asset condition information is presented on a single page, in easy-to-read tables, charts and graphs.

- On the top of the page, there are details about the asset, and KPIs that give a snapshot of its current state.
- For this asset, there is a health score of 44, which is in the medium “fair” zone.  
- This asset also has a high criticality and low risk score. 
- This asset has a low percentage of probability that there will be an imminent failure, based on the install date and manufacturers recommended life.
- The asset is projected to fail in the next 0 days, but the next maintenance isn't planned for 30 days.

At the beginning of the investigation, the asset was expected to fail before its planned maintenance.  But, just by looking at the KPIs, additional evidence suggests that this asset may be in trouble, and that some action needs to be taken.

    Follow the action items below.

1. Scroll down the page

The application supports critical asset-specific calculations and visualizations. Dissolved gas analysis is an example for the transformers.  It offers two types of visualization widgets.

![setup_assets](./img/HPU_8.9/HPU 90.png)

The first one is Duval triangle. It shows the current dissolved gas situation.  Click on each of the dots to get detailed information.

Click the switcher on the top-right corner to view the result in the list view.

The other widget is the history of combustible gas concentrations. It shows the combustible gas trend and rating over time

The rating represents the average acceptability of detected gas concentrations. The rating is determined by the overall factor.

Hover on each of the assessment dates to get the detailed information.

There are several predictive models built to score against incoming sensor data for the asset.
![setup_assets](./img/HPU_8.9/HPU 91.png)

!!! note "Value"
    IBM Predict includes templates to help a Data Scientist get started building models to project days to failure, calculate probability of failure, detect anomalies, and generate an asset life curve based on group asset deployment and retirement dates.  These templates include a large number of algorithms and can automatically select the one that best fits the data for the optimal outcome.

Note that also included with MAS is Watson Studio and Watson Machine Learning, both of which a Data Scientist can use for building, training, and maintaining predictive models.

In the case of this asset, the model tells us that it is projected to fail in 0 days...plus or minus 1 day. 

- Depending on the richness of the failure history, a Data Scientist can build predictive models for specific failure modes.  And the RE can select those failure modes within the widget to see the projection for each.
- Also in the widget, there is information about the training data to help decide when a 

The Failure probability widget can show how different failure modes impact predictions.  For example, it might show the asset has a 20% probability of failure in the next 2 months due to overheating.
- A Data Scientist can build specific models for time periods.  And just like the failure modes, the user can look at the results by making different selections within the widget.
- Failure probability history shows how the probability of failure for each mode has changed over time.

The factors that contribute to failure show which factors from the training data impacted failures the most, giving an indication of what may lead to future failures.
The anomaly detection model creates a threshold based on history and shows when the asset exceeds that threshold in the widget.

The end of life curve is built based on training data for assets that have been decommissioned.   By applying the effective age calculation from the notebook, this curve can be used to estimate probability of an end of life failure.

The effective age of the transformer is 27 years.  The curve produces an end of life probability of  89%...one more piece of evidence to show that this asset needs to be attended to immediately.

!!! attention "Actions"
    Follow the action items below.

1. Hover NEAR the point where the effective age crosses the curve
2. Scroll down the page

Below the “Predictions” section there is an “Asset timeline” that shows several pieces of key information about the asset in the same graph. For example, the timeline shows a predicted failure (on the top line of the graph), that will occur before the next preventive maintenance (on the second line of the graph). 
![setup_assets](./img/HPU_8.9/HPU 92.png)

!!! note "Value"
    Information on the chart, like past work orders and inspection, provide valuable insight into the asset's history, and may support what kind of action to take.

!!! attention "Actions"
    Follow the action items below.

1. Hover over a point on the timeline
2. Scroll down the page

There are several other sections on this page including operational status, showing recent meter readings, maintenance history, showing work orders for this asset, and a replacement planning section, showing any replacement or refurbishment plans created for this particular asset.

!!! note "Value"
    While each piece of information, or widget, gives nsight into the state of our asset, all of the information together, gives a richer view, and helps make a data-driven decision on how to address this asset.

### Take Action with AIO

In Health and Predict – Utilities, there’s a capability to build an Asset Investment Optimizer (AIO) project.

The AIO process starts with building a project of assets, assigning a length and starting date to the project, then running multiple strategies to determine which assets should be replaced over the life of the project, and when.

!!! note "Value"
    Utilizing advanced data-driven analytics to optimize OPEX and CAPEX comprehensively from various dimensions.

In this case, a project has already been built with the 35 assets in the “red” cell, and the 26 assets in the “yellow” cell next to it.

## Summary
<a name="summary"></a>

As the Reliability Engineer, maintaining the grid, I was able to use IBM Maximo Health and Predict – Utilities to identify assets at risk, investigate those assets, and finally take an action to prevent a failure and unplanned downtown…saving thousands of dollars, and maintaining the integrity of the grid.

My actions will also help short, medium and long term investment decisions that drive maintenance and replacement policies.
