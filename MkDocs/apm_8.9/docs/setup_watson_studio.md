# Setup Watson Studio for Predict

In this exercise you will setup and configure Watson Studio to use the Health and Predict notebook templates. The templates can be used for detecting anomalies and predicting asset failures of assets and for other purposes using Health and Predict - Utilities.

Starting with v8.9, you can use the new auto upload feature to more efficiently upload Predict notebooks into your Watson Studio project. This is an enhancement from the previous method, which required users to manually retrieve multiple credentials and upload notebooks into Watson Studio one-by-one.

After the auto upload is complete, you can start using the Predict library PMlib and the Watson Studio notebooks right away.

- [Get URL and User credentials](#get-credentials) to access Watson Studio.
- [Create a project](#create-project) in Watson Studio.
- [Auto upload Predict notebooks](#auto-upload) to automatically retrieve credentials and upload Predict notebooks into Watson Studio.
- [Use Watson Studio Python library](#watson-studio-library) `ibm_watson_studio_lib` to do to work with data assets in your project.

## Auto Upload Predict Notebooks
<a name="auto-upload"></a>

The new auto upload feature saves considerable amount of time and allows the user to start using Predict right away. It should take less than 15 minutes to complete the entire upload. All the work is automatically done by Predict workspace’s Ansible operator in the background.

To start the auto upload, you need to get the Project ID from the Watson Studio project you just created and add it to Predict’s workspace configuration.

1. Go to the `Manage` tab. Find and copy the Project ID. Alternatively, you can also retrieve it from the URL.
![Copy project ID](img/apm_8.9/p70.png) 

2. Login to MAS to enter the Project ID.

3. Click on the `Administration` icon on the top right corner.
![Enter project ID](img/apm_8.9/p71.png) 

4. On the sidebar menu, select `Workspace`
![Go to Workspace](img/apm_8.9/p72.png)

5. Make sure that you are on the `Overview` tab. Scroll down to find the `Predict` widget.
![Workspace page](img/apm_8.9/p73.png)

6. Click on `Predict` to access the Predict workspace details.
![Predict widget](img/apm_8.9/p74.png)

7. Click on he `Action` menu. Click on `Update configurations`.

8. Click the `Edit` button next to `IBM Watson Studio Settings` to update Predict configurations.
![Edit configuration](img/apm_8.9/p78.png)

9. Scroll down to `Advanced settings` and find `IBM Watson Studio Project Settings`. The `System managed`setting is turned on by default. Toggle it off so that you can enter the project ID.
![Toggle setting OFF](img/apm_8.9/p79.png)

10. You should be able to see the project ID field after turning the toggle off. Paste the project ID that you retrieved from your Watson Studio project. For instances outside of of IBM hardware, you may need to specify the IBM Watson Machine Learning URL, for more details see [Setup IBM Watson Machine Learning URL](#setup-ibm-watson-machine-learning-url)
![Paste project ID](img/apm_8.9/p80.png)

11. A popup will show up asking for confirmation to activate Predict. Click `Activate` to apply change and start activation.
![Activate Predict](img/apm_8.9/p81.png)

12. It should take roughly 15 minutes to upload all the data files and notebooks into Watson Studio. You can see the status in a widget in the details section.
![Preload status](img/apm_8.9/p82.png)

13. Once the upload is complete, go back to Cloud Pak for Data and go to your Watson Studio project. Click on the `Assets` tab, and you should see that all the data files are successfully uploaded, including the Predict Python PMlib zip file and the Db2 certificate file, in the data section.
![PMlib and Db2 certification files](img/apm_8.9/p83.png)

14. The process also auto-constructs an environment file. This is done by automatically retrieving 3 credentials needed to construct the file: `APM _ID`, `APM_API_BASEURL`, and `EXTERNAL_APM_API_BASEURL`. The only piece that was not automatically constructed is the `APM_API_KEY`. Please refer to one of the previous lab versions if you would like to manually find environment variables used in Predict.

##  Using Watson Studio Library
<a name="watson-studio-library"></a>

The Watson Studio Python Library named `ibm_watson_studio_lib` allows you to do to work with data assets in your project.  Some examples you will learn later are reading and writing data from your project.    Another example is getting the Watson Studio Project Information. 

You will use a Watson Studio Python library named `ibm_watson_studio_lib` that is available in your environment by default to get your project information.  See this [API reference](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cloud-paks/cp-data/4.0?topic=lib-watson-studio-python) for more information. 

**Sample Code**

    #  Get the Watson Studio Project Information
    from ibm_watson_studio_lib import access_project_or_space
    wslib = access_project_or_space()
    project_name = wslib.here.get_name()
    wslib.show(project_name)
    project_id = wslib.here.get_ID()
    wslib.show(project_id)

Congratulations you have seen how to create a project auto upload Predict notebooks in Watson Studio, including the PMlib documentation you will use in the next exercises. Finally you learned how to use the `ibm_watson_studio_lib` to work with assets in your project.

In the next exercises you will learn how to use these notebook templates to detect anomalies and predict asset failures.   You will start by update and running setup notebooks to create asset types in Health and Predict.  

## Setup IBM Watson Machine Learning URL
This step should only be executed after all preceeding steps have been completed and the auto upload feature returns an error. The objective is to correctly point MAS applications to Cloud Pak for Data under varying deployment configurations. 

1. Obtain your Cloud Pak for Data URL either by following the steps in [this section](#get-url-and-user-credentials-to-access-watson-studio) or by copy the base url of your Cloud Pak for Data instance. Copy or save this URL for the next step.

2. Login to MAS to enter the IBM Watson Machine Learning URL.

3. Click on the `Administration` icon on the top right corner.
