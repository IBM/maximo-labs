# Create Custom Score Using a Notebook
This notebook will create a health scoring group and the associated health, and custom score - `PUMP HYDRAULIC EFFICIENCY`. These instructions will be based off using the '1.2_Create-PUMP-SG_CustomScoreType.ipynb' file with the Pump demo data which included in hpu_csv_demo data set at `https://github.ibm.com/Watson-IoT/eam-hpu-lab/csv-files`.

In this exercise you will use Watson Studio, MAS Health and Predict Utilities to:

1. [Upload the and Run the HPU Health Score Group notebook](#run_notebook) to create custom score and score group in Maximo Health. 
2. [Confirm](#confirm_upload) Scoring groups have been created and scores have been calculated
3. [Handle Errors](#error_handling) that may come up in the process

!!! note****

    You must complete the previous exercise for [Setup Watson Studio](setup_watson_studio.md) before you start this exercise.

This notebook can only be run once per environment per site with the same set of assets. 

## Pre-requisites 

- Ensure you have access to asset data files for the Health and Predict Utilities Demo Data
- Ensure you have loaded the hpu_csv_demo data into the Health and Predict Utilities system.
- Complete the [Load Data into Manage](../../apm_8.7/asset_data_loader) lab for the Utilities data, ensure you have loaded the hpu_csv_demo data into the Health and Predict Utilities system.

!!! note

    It is best to perform this lab in your own Watson Studio Project created using [Setup Watson Studio](setup_watson_studio.md) instructions. If you are using a shared project, ensure you append each file uploaded with your initials and update the file paths in the notebooks to include that change.

## Upload files and run the Data Loader Notebook
<a name="run_notebook"></a>

1. Upload the Creat PUMP Score Groups' notebook from the github in the `https://github.ibm.com/Watson-IoT/eam-hpu-lab/notebooks` to your project.    
Click 'New asset' button in the project, and filter for notebook type.
   
    ![New Asset](img/apm_8.9/pump_sg1.png)   
       
    ![Choose notebook type](img/apm_8.9/pump_sg2.png){ width=70% height=70% } 

2. Select the `1.2_Create-PUMP-SG_CustomScoreType.ipynb` notebook, and then click Create button. 
    ![Choose notebook](img/apm_8.9/pump_sg3.png)   

3. Click on the `pencil` icon next to your notebook to open it in edit mode.

4. If the notebook fails to start, restart it.  Click on the `i` icon , `Environment` tab,  `Running status` dropdown select box and choose `Restart`

    ![Restarting Environment](img/apm_8.7/HPU_dataloader_3.png){ width=30% height=30% } 

5. Run the first code cell to import packages

6. Fetch MX_BASE_URL and MX_APIKEY as instructued below and store it as HPU_Envs.json file in below format, then upload to ws project(If it's already prepared, skip this step).    
    ```
    {
    "Instruction":{
        "MX_BASE_URL":"Extract health or manage host, and replace ******* in https://*******/maximo/, e.g Get main.manage.ivt13rel88.ivt.suite.maximo.com from https://main.manage.ivt13rel88.ivt.suite.maximo.com/maximo/oslc/graphite/relengineer/index.html",
        "MX_APIKEY":"Application Administration -> Search and enter the API Keys application-> Copy key from admin user card (e.g. 6805t46gn3tef37pu0picpg9vcq3hsmamm1enc43), or Add API key if not exist."
    },
    "MX_APIKEY":"********************",
    "MX_BASE_URL":"http://health-team31.fyre.ibm.com:9084/maximo/"
    }
    ```   

7. Update the site id value to your `SITE_ID` and the prefix value to your org id `ORG_ID` in the second cell

9. Run the next cell to define the API call for Maximo

10. Run the next cell to define function for creating the following:

    a. Create a new custom score type

    b. The query that will be used to build the health scores
    
    c. Get the scores list and activate the scores
    
    d. Create the internal group, add scores and contributors for the asset group and clean up
    
11. Run the next cell to create the query for the Asset Scoring Group. This query will be made up of Asset Type and Site ID

12. Run the next cell to create `PUMP HYDRAULIC EFFICIENCY` score type, ignore the error if it's already there. 

13. Run the next two cells to create factors and add some work order data for the later calculation

14. Clean up and then create the Asset Scoring Group using the query from the previous cell, Build the scores with formulas, and activate the scores, and trigger the calculation.

## Confirm Proper Score Group Created
<a name="confirm_upload"></a>
The following steps will confirm that the score group was created properly

1. Navigate to `Maximo Health and Predict for Utilities` for the provided environment

2. Go to the `Scoring and DGA Settings` application within Maximo H&PU

3. Search for your Org or Site and notice that there are one score group created for Pump Assets. 

    ![Score Groups](img/apm_8.9/pump_sg4.png)
4. Click into the Score Groups and notice all the score types created via the the notebook listed in the `Group Details` section, click any score to check the score details.

    ![PUMP HYDRAULIC EFFICIENCY Score Details](img/apm_8.9/pump_sg7.png)   

5. Back to Score group detail, click `Calculate Scores` and allow the scores to calculate.

6. Click into any asset and see that the scores have calculated

Congratulations you have seen how to use this notebook to create new custom score and used it in a score group. You have also gained experience using Jupyter Notebooks in Watson Studio!

In the next exercises you will learn not only how to directly create these on UI , but also how to use the new score type in other pages.
