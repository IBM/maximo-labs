#### Overview

Spaces are rarely used to their full potential. They are often overused or underused which can lead to productivity loss. Some rooms could be divided, while others should be augmented. Space optimization has a direct impact on energy and the cost of real estate, but more importantly on employees productivity and wellbeing.

`Webex Devices` provide us with People count that uses IOT sensors and AI to accurately detect humans, whether they are facing the `Webex Device` or not. This data makes it easy to plan and optimise spaces based on usage trends.

#### Purpose of Cisco Webex Integration in Monitor

MAS Monitor is designed to offer comprehensive real-time visibility and monitoring of critical infrastructure and assets. This real-time data collection enables businesses to monitor performance, detect anomalies, and respond promptly to any issues that may arise. 
By integrating Cisco Webex devices, Monitor enhances its capabilities, in terms of real-time people presence count and usage analytics.
Cisco Webex devices are leveraged to track people presence in specific locations. These devices provide accurate counts of individuals in meeting rooms, offices, or other designated areas in real time.

This people presence data is invaluable for several reasons:

* Space Utilization: By understanding how spaces are used, organizations can optimize their layouts, ensuring that rooms and areas are appropriately sized and equipped for their actual usage.
* Resource Allocation: Real-time presence data helps in allocating resources more effectively. For instance, cleaning schedules can be adjusted based on actual room usage rather than fixed schedules.
