## Overview of Maximo Asset Monitor

IBM Maximo Asset Monitor enables AI-powered remote monitoring at enterprise scale for asset maintenance and operations 
leaders seeking to optimize operating performance with fewer, more accurate alerts, and greater insights into what is 
causing them.

IBM Maximo Asset Monitor aggregates operating state data and process parameters across legacy systems, historians, IoT
 sensors, and other repositories to provide enterprise-wide visibility into performance. It scales quickly and easily 
 across the enterprise. AI-powered monitoring identifies only the right alerts while helping you understand complex 
 relationships between factors causing failures. This empowers your OT and IT teams to act with speed and confidence to 
 understand root-cause and drive digital re-invention.

With Maximo Asset Monitor, asset sensors can be securely registered with the included IoT service to provide key 
performance indicators about the condition of an asset. These metrics can be combined in a pipeline with other business 
service data, analyzed by data science models, and then visualized in a responsive, customizable dashboard, all without 
requiring any coding.

Anomaly models can help reduce the “noise” that is caused by hundreds of false positive alerts using traditional threshold
 alerts. AI models allow clients to focus on and resolve the most critical anomalies.

## Business Benefits

Many clients have already adopted Maximo for Enterprise Asset Management (EAM), and they are realizing the benefits of 
extending the life of their capital investments while reducing operational and maintenance costs. They want to further 
leverage these assets by using the real-time operational data of those assets. For example:

* Product owners can create new “as a service” revenue sources by using new business models enabled by IoT and thereby 
improving their product or service user experiences, which will increase their customers’ loyalty.

* Operations and maintenance leaders can reduce operational maintenance and extend the life of their capital investments.

* Reliability engineers can view historical data for forensic analysis of failure trends that allow them to prioritize 
design improvements to reduce warranty costs and system downtime.

* Compliance officers can better document historical trends to demonstrate regulatory compliance and reduce the cost and 
risk of non-compliance.
