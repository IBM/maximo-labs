# Unsubscribe to Cisco Webex device

We can unsubscribe Cisco Webex device from Cisco Webex Integrations.

When we unsubscribe a Webex device we remove that device from Monitor. That means that we will not be reading any realtime people presence count for that device. While unsubscribing we have an option to delete device data or keep the device data and remove just the device from Monitor:</br>
