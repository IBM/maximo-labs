It will show all available devices and subscribed devices. From there, we get an option `Assign location` in the ellipses icon to Assign the Cisco Webex device to a location.</br>

On click `Assign location`, we get a pop-up to assign device to a location in the Real Estate and Facilities location hierarchies:</br>

After we assign a Webex device to a location. We can view that in Monitor Hierarchies as well as in the overview section of that particular location.</br>

Expand Setup under the Monitor setup section in the left menu and select `Hierarchies`:</br>

In `Hierarchies`, we can check `Location` in below manner.</br>

`Organisation` -> `Site` -> `System` -> `Location`.</br>

Under `Location` where we have assigned Cisco Webex device, that specific device will be incorporated.</br>
