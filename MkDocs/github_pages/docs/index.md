# Welcome to the IBM Maximo Github Pages Lab
This lab will document the tasks needed in order to use Github Pages to host the Maximo Labs:

* Changes to the github repo to use Github Pages
* Edit mkdocs.yml files for all labs
* Change image location in all md files and modify the build_all_mkdocs script
* Change lunks in all md files to adhere to the new standard in MKdocs
* Deploy to Github Pages


A minimized replica of the originial `monitor-hands-on-labs` has been used in order to experiment and identify the needed changes. The experimentation has been done in a new Github repo in the IBM organization, 
called `maximo-labs-test`. 

The results are documented her in this lab, so it can be used to modify the full Maximo Labs repo.
