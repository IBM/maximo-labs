# Welcome to the </br>Maximo Monitor Integration With Omnio Edge Lab
You will learn about how to setup the integration between Omnio Edge and Maximo Monitor.

In this lab I will show you the steps needed to successfully setup the integration using some virtual Variable Frequency Drives that will deliver the device data over Modbus/TCP over an Omnio Edge gateway and into Maximo Monitor.</br></br>

The steps will cover:

* Setting up your environment
* Create the needed device types in Maximo monitor
* Create the Omnio Edge configuration
* Verify data flow from Modbus/TCP variable frequency drives all the way into Maximo monitor
* Have fun

!!! note
    Expected time needed to run the complete lab: 1 hour and 30 minutes
