##  Install Node-RED locally

This is a fairly easy step, as you just have to follow this guide:
[Running Node-RED locally](https://nodered.org/docs/getting-started/local)

It will work for Mac, Windows, and various Linux distributions - but I used a local nmp installed version of Node-RED on my Mac.
