# Welcome to the Maximo Monitor CSV Importer Lab<br>(Version: 8.6)
You will learn about how to import historical data into Monitor using CSV files and Node-RED.
It is based on an existing reusable node-red script that needs to be imported to a non-cloud based instance of Node-RED as it requires access to a file system where the CSV files are located.

In this lab I will show you the steps needed to successfully import the historical data.</br>
The steps will cover:

* Setting up your environment
* Get and adjust the Node-RED script
* Using the script to create the device type in Monitor
* Inject the CSV data directly into the database
* Have fun

!!! note
    Expected time needed to run the complete lab: 1 hour and 30 minutes
