# Getting Started

In this lab, you will learn how to provision the Maximo Application Suite core and all of its dependencies, as well as Maximo Manage and Maximo Monitor with a DB2 database on IBM Cloud's managed-hosted OpenShift cluster (aka ROKS). You could also provision Cloud Pak for Data for optionally dependent components such as Watson Machine Learning.

This lab will guide you through the process of creating a working instance of Maximo Application Suite using the officially available Ansible automation method. The lab includes all of the necessary Ansible variables in a handy script. 

The Maximo Application Suite allows users to sign on to a single, integrated platform to access key monitoring, maintenance, and reliability applications across the business. Not only does it help remove data silos, it enhances data sharing with integrated user experience and shared administrative controls for enterprise-scale execution. https://www.ibm.com/products/maximo


**Disclaimer and limitation**

This deployment lab is only suitable for sandbox environments. A sandbox environment is typically used only for testing. Self-signed certificates with a default domain will be used in this lab. This lab is not intended for use in production-deployment scenarios. Only IBM Cloud ROKS Classic OpenShift and/or OpenShift with Data Foundation storage are supported by this lab. It may not work with all OpenShift flavors running on various other platforms.
