<h2>Next Steps</h2>

Congratulations! You have completed this lab and are now able to:

- Understand how to navigate the MVI Platform and MVI Mobile
- Create data sets, augment data, train and deploy models 
- Create an inspection on MVI Mobile.
- Look at your pass/fail inspection rate on a dashboard

<h2>Extra Credit</h2>

If you have extra time:

1. Go back to the `Projects` tab and see how your new data set, `Inspection Results-YourInitials`, that you created in the app, is now a part of your project.

2. Go to the `Data Sets` tab and select your new data set, `Inspection Results-YourInitials`, and take a look at the new images you took. 

3. Your model might be finished training and at 0% accuracy. You can go back and augment the data even more or add your own pictures to create a more accurate model. Use a photo of a can to test your new model.  <b>*Remember, it will not be as accurate because we did not train the model with a lot of images.*</b>
