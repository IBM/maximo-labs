# Welcome to the IBM Maximo Monitor Auto AI Lab<br>(Version: 8.5)

You will learn about Monitor's capabilities to use AutoAI to identify and deploy a prediction machine learning model to 
Maximo Application Suite

In this lab we will show you how to use AutoAI to identify, train  and then deploy to a prediction machine learning model 
to Maximo Asset Monitor. You will learn how to:

1.  Use the provided Jupyter notebook that will contain Python code to train, test and deploy machine learning model to
    Maximo Asset Monitor
    
2.  Use the provided Maximo Asset Monitor custom function to make predictions as new time series data is received in
    Maximo Asset Monitor
    
3.  Create Asset Types and devices using simulated pump data. 

4.  Create an Asset Type and Asset dashboards to see the pump data and model predictions in Monitor



## Prerequisites

This Hands on Lab requires:

*  Your instructor can provide you the data, example Python Scripts, functions 
and Notebooks.

* An account for IBM ID and An IBM Cloud Account Trial  [here](http://ibm.biz/maximo-dev-ibmcloud)

* Access to a Maximo Asset Monitor environment. Request access from your instructor. 

* [Understand Virtual Environments](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/)

* [Setup a local development environment.](setup_local_environment.md)  Check if you instructor has already provided you access to one. 

* [Introduction to using Jupyter Notebooks](https://realpython.com/jupyter-notebook-introduction/#:~:text=The%20Jupyter%20Notebook%20is%20an,the%20people%20at%20Project%20Jupyter.)

* Understanding of Pandas for Time series data processing:
