!!! note

    The installation of demo data includes all demo users. Before you can use any of the demo user accounts, you must first configure their email and password.

2\. Set the dummy email and click on Replace forgotton password. Give maxadmin the full admin rights on the Suite. Click Save.

!!! tip

    Setting up user accounts usually takes a few minutes while the database is synchronized. Check the usersync pods of the respective projects for troubleshooting (if necessary).

3\. Log out as an admin user and log in as maxadmin. Launch Manage and Health applications to validate. Accept the self-signed warning if prompted.
