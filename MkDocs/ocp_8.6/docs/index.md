# Welcome to the Maximo Application Suite 8.6 with Manage & Health Deployment Lab on OpenShift in IBM Cloud<br>(Version: 1.0)

You will learn how to install the components of the [Maximo Application Suite (MAS) 8.6 with Manage + Health including demo data](https://www.ibm.com/products/maximo) along with all the dependencies, on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform. You will learn how to deploy:

* MongoDB

* Behavior Analytics Service
* Suite Licensing Service
* Maximo Application Suite Core
* Cloud Pak for Data v3.5
* DB2 Warehouse
* **Maximo Manage, Maximo Health with demo data**

!!! tip

    This is a second of its kind of lab. We have perviously published a lab for [MAS 8.5](https://mam-hol.eu-gb.mybluemix.net/ocp_8.5/). This new lab is for MAS 8.6. In addition to the provisioning of MAS core, this lab will introduce you to the DB2 Warehouse and the deployment of Maximo Manage, Maximo Health, along with setting up of demo data.

!!! note

    ‚è∞ It may take up to 2+ hours to deploy MAS core with Manage+Health and demo data including all dependencies. The entire deployment time is determined by your Linux, Kubernetes, and OpenShift skills and experience.

This tutorial is still under development and it may change at any time. This is not an automated one-click installation. You should be familiar with Linux in particular, as well as Kubernetes/OpenShift in general. Consult IBM's other resources for Ansible-based [automated](https://ibm-mas.github.io/ansible-devops/) deployments.
