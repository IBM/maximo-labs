# Welcome to the </br>Maximo Monitor Edge Data Collector Lab
You will learn about how to setup an integration for an Edge Data Collector within Maximo Monitor.

In this lab you will learn the steps needed to successfully setup an integration using some virtual Variable Frequency Drives (VFD) that will deliver the device data over Modbus/TCP via Edge Data Collector into Maximo Monitor using the pre-configured connector for Lenze i550 VFD from the Device Connector Library.</br></br>

The exercises will cover:

* Setting up the simulator environment
* Create the needed device types in Maximo Monitor
* Create an Edge Data Collector Integration
* Verify data flow from Modbus/TCP Variable Frequency Drives all the way into Maximo Monitor
* Have fun

!!! note
    Expected time needed to run the complete lab: 1 hour
