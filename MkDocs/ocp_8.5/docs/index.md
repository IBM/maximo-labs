# Welcome to the Maximo Application Suite 8.5 Deployment Lab on Red Hat OpenShift Kubernetes Services (ROKS) in IBM Cloud<br>(Version: 1.0)

This tutorial walks you through how to deploy [Maximo Application Suite (MAS) 8.5](https://www.ibm.com/products/maximo) on Red Hat's OpenShift with all the dependencies. By completing this tutorial, you learn how to deploy MongoDB, Behavior Analytics Service, Suite Licensing Service and Maximo Application Suite Core.

You will need MAS Installer file (available via IBM Passport Advantage) and MAS license file (available via Partner World or your IBM representative). You will also need [IBM Cloud - ROKS cluster](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/openshift) of at least 5 nodes (b3c.16x64).

‚è∞ It may take about 1.5 hours to deploy MAS core with all the dependencies excluding all the suite's application. The total deployment time is dependent upon your skills and experience with Linux, Kubernetes and OpenShift.

<sub>Disclaimer: This tutorial is a work-in-progress and may change soon. This is not a one-click scripted install. You are expected to have experience with Linux in particular, and Kubernetes/OpenShift in general.</sub>
