# Welcome to the Maximo Application Suite 8.5 Deployment Lab on Red Hat OpenShift Kubernetes Services (ROKS) in IBM Cloud<br>(Version: 1.0)

This guide will show you how to install [Maximo Application Suite (MAS) 8.5](https://www.ibm.com/products/maximo) and all of its dependencies on Red Hat's OpenShift Container Platform.
You will learn how to deploy MongoDB, Behavior Analytics Service, Suite Licensing Service, Maximo Application Suite Core, and more by finishing this course.

‚è∞ It may take up to 1.5 hours to deploy MAS core, including all dependencies, and excluding all of the suite's apps. The entire deployment time is determined by your Linux, Kubernetes, and OpenShift skills and experience.

<sub>This tutorial is a work-in-progress, and it may change at any time. This is not an automated one-click installation. You should be familiar with Linux in particular, as well as Kubernetes/OpenShift in general.</sub>
