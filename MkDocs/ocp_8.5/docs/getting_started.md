## Getting Started with the Maximo Application Suite Deployment Labs

You will need the following to get started.

1.  Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform-RHOCP in IBM Cloud Classic (version 4.6 is preferred at the time of the writing). 
You may be able to obtain cloud resources for your PoC through a cloud credit arrangement of [IBM Cloud](https://cloud.ibm.com). 
The [Tech Zone](https://techzone.ibm.com) is another option for IBMers and business partners to acquire the OpenShift 
cluster.
2.  A working environment (remote virtual machine) that has been configured with the necessary tools and utilities. See 
also Pre-Requisites.
3.  The installer file for Maximo Application Suite (available through IBM Passport Advantage) and the license file
