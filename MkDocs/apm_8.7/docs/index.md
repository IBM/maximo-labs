# Welcome to the IBM Maximo Asset Performance Management Lab<br> for MAS version 8.7

!!! note
    This lab is still being developed, incomplete and not ready for use.

This lab provides step by step instructions and code examples to help you learn about the product capabilities 
IBM Maximo Monitor, Health and Predict.  You will learn how to use the provided scripts to:

-  Create an organization, site, system and location hierarchy in Monitor
-  Create a compressor asset and it's senor tag devices in Monitor
-  Ingest compressor sensor data using real data in Monitor
-  Create Health Scores and Risks in Health
-  Measure the health of the compressor asset in Health,
 
This lab provides step by step instructions and code examples to help you:
 
1.  Use Maximo Monitor to create hierarchies for organizing your assets and devices. 
2.  Use Maximo Monitor to create assets and assign devices to your hierarchy
3.  Use IOT service included with  Maximo Monitor to create Compressor sensor tags device type and metric mappings: create_device_types.md
4.  Publish Compressor sensor tag device data: publish_device_data.md
5.  Create Compressor Asset Health Scores: create_health_score.md
6.  View Compressor Asset Health: view_asset_health.md

## Prerequisites

This Hands on Lab requires:

* Your instructor to provide you the data, Python Scripts, functions and Notebooks.  

* An account for IBM ID and An IBM Cloud Account Trial  [here](http://ibm.biz/maximo-dev-ibmcloud)

* Access to a Maximo Application Suite v8.7 environment. Request access from your instructor. 

* [Understanding of Python  Virtual Environments](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/)

* [Setup a local development environment.](setup_local_environment.md)  This is a local desktop environment for running 
Python scripts for creating resources in Maximo.
