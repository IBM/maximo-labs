Use the steps from the previous exercise [Add Notebook From File to a Watson Studio Project](setup_watson_studio.md) Prepend your initials to the template.  If you already have uploaded the notebook, open it with Watson Studio.

1. You can download the documentation using a URL similar to the one you create in the previous Exercise for downloading the `doc-8.5.1.zip` that contains the html files for the `pmilib` documentation.

For example: 

    https://`EXTERNAL_APM_API_BASEURL`/ibm/pmi/service/rest/ds/`APM_ID`/`APM_API_KEY`/doc/download

2. Unzip the `doc-8.5.1.zip` file you downloaded

3. Click on the file `index.html` file you unzipped.  The browser should open with the documentation below.
![add_to project](/img/apm_8.7/p59.png)   



## Setup Environment Variables for Predict in Notebook Templates

One of the earlier steps explained how to manually find the environment variables used in Predict to do things like download the zip file with the Predict Notebooks.  When using a Predict Notebook in Watson Studio you can also programatically discover these environment variables since they are set for you in the Cloud Pack for Data Environment that was installed with Maximo Application Suite.  Use the code below  if it isn't already included in the notebook templates to get the required Predict environment variables.

**Sample Code**

    import json
    import os

    # Try to open environment variables json file if it already exists.
    try:
      f = open('/project_data/data_asset/hc_Predict_Envs.json',)
    except:
      f = {}
      print("No execution json found, initialising with current notebook information")

    data = json.load(f)
    f.close()

    os.environ['APM_ID'] = data['APM_ID']
    os.environ['APM_API_BASEURL'] = data['APM_API_BASEURL']
    os.environ['APM_API_KEY'] = data['APM_API_KEY']

    # README: Change to true if Health/Predict are deployed on different cluster from this CP4D environment
    use_external = False
    if use_external:
        import os
        os.environ['USER_PROVIDED_HEALTH_URL'] = data['USER_PROVIDED_HEALTH_URL']
        os.environ['USER_PROVIDED_DB_CONNECTION_STRING'] = data['USER_PROVIDED_DB_CONNECTION_STRING']
        os.environ['USER_PROVIDED_URL'] = data['USER_PROVIDED_URL']
    import os

    os.environ['SSL_VERIFY_APM'] = 'False'
    os.environ['SSL_VERIFY_AS'] = 'False'

    os.environ['TRUST_PREDICT'] = os.getenv('APM_API_BASEURL')[8:]
    print(os.getenv('TRUST_PREDICT'))
    main.predict.ivt11rel87.ivt.suite.maximo.com
    import os
    os.environ['TRUST_PREDICT'] = os.getenv('APM_API_BASEURL')[8:]
    print(os.getenv('TRUST_PREDICT'))


## PIP Install PMLib Predict in Notebook Templates

Install the Predict Python Software Develop Kit (SDK) called PMLib using pip install.

**Sample Code**

    # Initialize the Maximo-Predict environment variables
    import pmlib
    from pmlib import api
    api.init_environ()


##  Using Watson Studio Library

The Watson Studio Python Library named `ibm_watson_studio_lib` allows you to do to work with data assets in your project.  Some examples you will learn later are reading and writing data from your project.    Another example is getting the Watson Studio Project Information. 

You will use a Watson Studio Python library named `ibm_watson_studio_lib` that is available in your environment by default to get your project information.  See this [API reference](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cloud-paks/cp-data/4.0?topic=lib-watson-studio-python) for more information. 

**Sample Code**

    #  Get the Watson Studio Project Information
    from ibm_watson_studio_lib import access_project_or_space
    wslib = access_project_or_space()
    project_name = wslib.here.get_name()
    wslib.show(project_name)
    project_id = wslib.here.get_ID()
    wslib.show(project_id)

Congratulations you have seen how to upload, start and restart Predict notebook in Watson Studio.    You have also learned how to download and access the pmilib documentation that you will use in the next exercises.  Finally you learned how to use the `ibm_watson_studio_lib` to work with assets in your project.

In the next exercises you will learn how to use these notebook templates to detect anomalies and predict asset failures.   You will start by update and running setup notebooks to create asset types in Health and Predict.
