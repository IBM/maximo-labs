## Understand Asset Data
<a name="data_dictionary"></a>

This lab uses publicly available data for a centrifugal pump on [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nphantawee/pump-sensor-data/discussion/131429?resource=download)

The data is for a single pump that exhibited 7 failures.   The table below describes the columns with sensor time series data that are included in the CSV files. See the Kaggle web site for more explanation of the data.

Congratulations.  You now have sample pump data you can work with to analyze for anomalies and failures.

In a later lab exercise you will prepare the data for being used by Health and Predict for algorithm and model performance assessment using Watson Studio.
