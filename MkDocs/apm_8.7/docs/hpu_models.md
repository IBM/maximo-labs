6\. After select the notebook and query, click `Create` to create the score group.
![drawing](img/hpu_model_sc_setup_5.png)   


7\. After score group is created, system will redirect to the score group detail page, in this page, user can see all the scores and the asset list.
![drawing](img/hpu_model_sc_setup_6.png)   

8\. Click the score in the table, and active it on the right, scores need to be activated one by one based on the dependency.
![drawing](img/hpu_model_sc_setup_7.png)   

![drawing](img/hpu_model_sc_setup_8.png)    

9\. After activating all the scores, click the `Recalculate scores` to start the analysis.

## Update and Schedule Notebooks
<a name="modify_schedule"></a>

In this exercise you will check the notebook configuration file, notebook and the job, also update the notebook and save to latest version.  You will also schedule `Jobs` to run the notebooks and do asset scoring by changing the cron task schedule.  

In Health and Predict - Utilities, the scoring calculation happen in Watson Studio jobs. Each asset type has a configure file, notebook, and job deployed on Watson Studio project. When user clicks `Recalculate scores` on UI, it triggers the job to run, do the calculation, and save results to the Database.  

### Substation Transformer Model Configuration 

For ST (Substation Transformer), configuration file is named `IBM-Transformers-Tap-Changers-DGA-4.0.0.cfg`.
![drawing](img/hpu_model_ws_cfg.png)  

In the configuration file, under `Common` section `defaultsetup.components` has all the scores group, contributors listed, and functions and parameters for each item. In `defaultsetup.dependencies` section describes the dependencies. E.g Health depends on `Transformer health index` and `Tap changer health index`, `Transformer health index` group calculated based on several contributors.  Function details can be found in `[ext_function_name]` in the file named. E.g For `Health` ext_function_name is configured as `[Health Weighted]`, the implementation is `common_calculate_weighted` which is pre-defined in healthlib.

### Substation Transformer Model Notebook 

For ST(Substation Transformer), notebook is IBM-Transformers-Tap-Changers-DGA-4.0.0.ipynb as configured in cfg file.
![drawing](img/hpu_model_ws_notebook.png)   

Any permenant modification on notebook, will need save to a latest version to take affect, because each job binds with a version of the notebook, by default it's the `Latest` version.

### ST Watson Studio Job 

Job is `Run-IBM-Transformers-Tap-Changers-DGA-4-0-0.Details`and can be checked using the steps below.

1\. Login to Watson Studio, enter the project, and click the `Job` tab, click the job defined in configruation file, and then click `Edit Configuration`, click `Next` and `Next`, we can see by default it binds to `latest` version and runtime is `Default Python 3.8`, close the edit page by clicking `X` on the right corner.

![drawing](img/hpu_model_ws_job_04.png)   

### Customize Notebook Model for NOC

Users can change how the scores are calculated as needed in the Notebooks.  

For example, for customize the `Criticality` which is calculated 100% weight of NOC (Number Of Customers) by default.
Login Watson Studio, enter the project, click the `Assets` tab, enter the notebook `IBM-Transformers-Tap-Changers-DGA-4.0.0.ipynb`,find the cell which defined function `calculate_number_of_customer`, comment out the old code, and write new customize NOC functiion based on customer's own methodology. Then save a latest version.

```
//Code example.
@maximo_function
def calculate_number_of_customer(context,targetType=None):
    //Input customized logic here......
    logger = healthlib.get_logger()
    noc_attr = context.get_parameter(name='NOC attribute')
    logger.debug('Noc attribute=%s', noc_attr)

    noc = context.get_spec(noc_attr)
    logger.debug('noc=%s', noc)

    result = min(100,max(0, 100 * noc/10000))
    return result
```
### Update scheduler for cron task instance created during [score group set up](#score_groups) 

User can change the schedule by changing the crontask instance's schedule.

1\. Login and go to Health and Predict Utilities application, click `Scoring and DGA settings` in the menu, and search for the score group just created, click to enter the group details page to get the group id which later will be used to find the corresponding crontask instance.
![drawing](img/hpu_model_crontask_1.png){ width=50% height=50% }


2\. Click Administration administration to go to Administration page. Then click `Cron Task Setup` to enter the crontask application.<br>
![drawing](img/hpu_model_crontask_2.png){ width=30% height=30% }

## Troubleshoot
<a name="troubleshoot"></a>

### Enable Debug Mode

For a small group of assets, user can enable debug mode for debugging the model.

1. Login Watson Studio, enter the project, click the `Assets` tab, enter the notebook `IBM-Transformers-Tap-Changers-DGA-4.0.0.ipynb`, click the pencil icon to edit,find the cell `healthlib.set_log_level(level='INFO')`, change to `healthlib.set_log_level(level='DEBUG')`.Then save to a latest version.
2. Login Health and Predict Utilities application, go to `Scoring and DGA settings`, enter the related group, click the `Recalculate scores` to trigger a new analysis.
3. After the calculation finishes, go back to Watson Studio, click the `Job` tab, then click the correspoding job for the score group. 
4. A new page will open where user can edit the job and or check the job history. Click latest finished job history to check the debug logs. 

### Run Notebook Directly for Debugging Purpose

If user want to directly run the notebook to calculate the score for debug purpose instead of the job, user can add some enviroment variables in notebook temporarily.

1\. Login Watson Studio, enter the project, click the `Assets` tab, enter the notebook `IBM-Transformers-Tap-Changers-DGA-4.0.0.ipynb`, click the pencil icon to edit. Click plus button to add a new cell on top, and put below [code](#code_sample) sample with actual value.

Here are some code examples for debugging<a name="code_sample"></a>.

Code example for debugging on a certain score group.
```
import os
os.environ['maximo_context'] = '{"maximoUrl":"https://<health or manage host>/maximo/","maximoApiKey":"**************","expgroupname":"1003"}'
```

Code example for debugging on an individule asset.
```
import os
os.environ['maximo_context'] = '{"maximoUrl":"https://<health or manage host>/maximo/","maximoApiKey":"**************","expgroupname":"1003","siteid":"***","assetnum":"***"}'
```
![drawing](img/hpu_model_ws_notebook_debug.png)  


`maximoApiKey` can be found in Application administration page. Login Health and Predict – Utilities and click the Application administration page, click to the Start Center and in the Go To section, click Administration.On the API Keys tab, search and find maxadmin's apikey.
![drawing](img/hpu_model_ws_notebook_apikey_01.png)  

![drawing](img/hpu_model_ws_notebook_apikey_02.png)

`expgroupname` can be found in score group detail page.
![drawing](img/hpu_model_ws_notebook_expgroupname.png){ width=50% height=50% }  

For `<health or manage host>` in `maximoUrl` can be extracted from health url.
![drawing](img/hpu_model_ws_notebook_host.png){ width=50% height=50% }  


2\. Click `Run` to run cell by cell or restart the kernel run the whole notebook.
![drawing](img/hpu_model_ws_notebook_run.png)

!!! note

    When debugging in notebook directly, do not save as latest version, since it's hardcoded.  The corresponding job should instead get those inputs from Health during the runtime.

Congratulation you learned about the Substation Transformer Models included with Health and Predict - Utilities (HPU) and create a Score Groups.  You also can now modify, schedule and debug the model notebooks.
