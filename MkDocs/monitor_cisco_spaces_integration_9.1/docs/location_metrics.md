# Cisco Spaces Location Metrics 

Once the Cisco Spaces integration is set up and events are being processed successfully, IBM MAS Monitor begins to display real-time and historical **location-based metrics** fetched directly from Cisco Spaces.

These metrics provide deep insights into user presence, movement, and positioning within a mapped floor or space.

## Accessing Location Metrics

You can view metrics associated with a Cisco Spaces location using either of the following methods:

1. **Navigate via Floor Name Link**  
    - Go to the **Cisco Spaces Locations** table.  
    - Click on the **Floor Name** (which is a clickable link) for the subscribed location.

2. **Search from Locations Tab**  
    - Go to the **Monitor â†’ Locations** tab.  
    - Search for the location by its mapped **Floor Name**.
    - Select the matching location from the results to open the detailed location view.
