5. **Provide Integration Details**  
    - Enter a meaningful **Integration Name**. <br>
    - Paste the **Activation Token** you copied from the previous exercise. <br>
    - Click **Finish** to complete the integration setup.<br>

    !!! warning
        - Ensure the Activation Token is correct. 
        - Make sure the token has not expired.
        - Verify the token has not been used previously for activation. Once a token is activated, an activation key is stored in the database, making that token unusable for any other integration. One token can only be used for a single configuration.
        - Only a correct and valid token will be saved successfully; otherwise, the integration setup will fail with an error.

6. **Verify Integration**  
   Once the integration is added successfully, its details will appear on the **Integrations list** page. This confirms that the configuration has been saved.

7. **View locations **  
   Within a few minutes, the list of locations associated with the Activation Token will be fetched automatically from Cisco Spaces and displayed in MAS Monitor.
