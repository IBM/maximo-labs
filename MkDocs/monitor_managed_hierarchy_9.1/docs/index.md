# Welcome to the IBM Maximo Monitor Hierarchy Lab
You will learn about Maximo's capabilities to:

* Create an Organization
* Activate Organization
* Create Site 
* Create System
* Create Location
* Create Asset and Assign Location 
* Create Device-Type & Device in Monitor
* Hierarchy View
* Assign Devices using Location/Asset
* Assign Devices using csv

Monitor is now integrated with Manage, enabling seamless synchronization between the two systems for better operational efficiency.

Hierarchies are imported directly from Manage, eliminating the need for manual CSV uploads and simplifying the setup process.

Organization activation now requires cost-centre details to be entered in Manage, ensuring financial alignment and accountability from the outset.

Once organizations are activated in Manage, they automatically appear in Monitor under the Hierarchy section, reflecting their structure and relationships.

All hierarchy levels including Location, System, Asset, Site, and Organization are created and managed within Manage, centralizing control and consistency.

Devices and their types are created in Monitor, allowing for detailed tracking and monitoring of physical equipment.

Devices can only be assigned or unassigned to assets and locations, ensuring a focused and structured deployment within the hierarchy.
