# Objectives
In this Exercise you will learn how to verify that the data is bing delivered from RPE to MAS Monitor.

Data is being send once all `mqtt out` nodes are in state connected.

You will verify the setup by watching the data being send to the MAS Maximo Monitor instance you have access to.

## 1. Login
**a.** Login to your instance of Maximo Application Suite:</br>

**c.** A new browser tab opens with the MAS Watson IoT Platform Service. 
 
## 2. Verify data is being received.
**a.** Go to the Devices tab:</br>

**c.** Expand one of the devices and select Recent Events.</br>
After a few seconds you should see data being received:</br>

**e.** Repeat step c and d for the two other devices – just to verify data is being received.

!!! tip
    These properties are abbreviations for different measurements.</br>
    They are explained in the [RPE User Guide](user_guide.md) as well as the meaning of the SenseHAT LEDs.

**f.** This concludes this exercise.
