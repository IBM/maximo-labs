## Introduction
In this demonstration you will be a reliability engineer.   Your role is to maintain the reliability of the grid.  Your major 
responsibility is to ensure that the grid stays up and operational.  You are also responsible for making short, medium and 
long term investment decisions that drive maintenance and replacement policies. You use asset condition and operational 
data to gain insights into Asset Health, Probability of Failure and Risk, both today and into the future.

Thankfully you have a Health and Predict solution from IBM with advanced analytics that help you work efficiently and 
confidently without relying on spreadsheets or point solutions that consider 1 or 2 data sources.  Health and Predict 
incorporates multiple data sources such as `Asset Master` data from Manage, `Work order` data, historical `failure` data, `GeoSpatial` Data, 
`Inspection` and `Test` Logs, `IoT` and `Sensor` data.  Health and Predict provides a flexible asset condition framework for 
mining the asset condition data. Health and Predict helps you identify assets that are at greatest risk of failure, 
across different circuits/feeders, substations and regions. The risk assessment helps you drive asset and work management 
activities in Maximo Manage or other EAM systems to keep the grid up, reduce operational expense, optimize and defend 
capital expenditures resulting in better outcomes. 

Maximo Health and Predict are applications in Maximo Application Suite (MAS) that are targeted to the reliability engineer, 
and provide a view of the current state and future state of an enterprise's assets.  IBM Maximo Models for Electrical 
Distribution is an accelerator that extends Health and Predict designed for understanding the condition of electrical 
distribution asset classes used by the utilities industry.

###  Asset Table View
<a name="grid_view"></a>

On the main screen, there is a table view of all managed assets in a familiar table view. From this page you can quickly 
choose the asset query that reflects the assets you are responsible for. You can filter those assets to quickly identify 
the assets that have poor scores by sorting the assets or by searching for assets using key words so that you can get the 
latest asset details on an individual asset.

!!! note "Value"
    This is particularly valuable because it shows you a mix of both IT data (from Manage) and OT data (from Monitor) together in a single view.

This asset data is coming from Maximo Manage, but MAS can connect to other EAM systems with or App Connect, via API or 
using Monitor Connectors.

Different views of the data can be generated to make it easier to identify critical assets.  On this grid, you can 
add and move columns, filter, search and sort.

!!! attention "Actions"
    Follow the action items below.

1. Select the `hamburger` icon above to the magnifying glass to show the left navigation menus. This shows how you can

###  Map View
<a name="map_view"></a>

Another view to help identify assets in trouble is the map view.  Using a map view focused to a container  is a good way to
understand the capabilities and benefits of the Map view. Containers enable to you reflect the geolocation of your assets 
and geo fencing of business areas.  It could be a region, town, service subscriber area you are responsible for servicing.

We’ll look at a region that contains a mixture of transformers, circuit breakers, cables (OTWs), and switches. 
Select a group of assets, or a container, that contains a mixture of transformers, circuit breakers, cables (OTWs), and 
switches.

!!! note "Value"
    Seeing how assets are spatially distributed may assist with identifying and investigating assets at risk.  This is especially true in the utilities industry that have geo location dependencies on interconnectivity, weather or area of responsibility.

!!! attention "Actions"
    Follow the action items below.

1. You filter the group of assets you want to focus on.   Reset the `View` to show `All shared` assets.  Reference the early instructions if you forgot how to do this.
![show_all_assets](img/apm_8.9/show_all_assets.png)
2. Click the `filter` icon that looks like a funnel. 
![setup_assets](img/HPU_8.9/HPU 33.png)

6. Click `Apply`

![setup_assets](img/HPU_8.9/HPU 36.png)


You can see there are 261 assets in this container. When we sort by the health score from low to high, we find there are 
many assets with `Health` scores in poor health and many of them have a `Criticality` score of 0.  This is concerning.  Several column headers can be used to sort to help visualize the data in different ways. Sort by most critical assets 
and with the worst health.


!!! note "Value"
    Be able to quickly focus on the assets you are responsible for and in need of action.  


!!! attention "Actions"

1. On the `Assets Table` view, click `Health` column title to sort assets by the `Health` score.  
![setup_assets](img/HPU_8.9/HPU 37.png)

2.  Asset `Criticality` can be measured by understanding the importance an asset has to the grid performing it's job of providing 
electricity to customers.   Asset `End of Life` is important to know so that assets can be planned to be replaced before they reach 
their end of life.  On the `Assets Table` view, click `Criticality` column title to sort assets by the `Criticality` score. 



You need to understand the relative position of the assets with the worst health and most critical in reference to the service are you are responsible for.

12. You can also see the number of asset in the matrix in the future years if you have configured your forecast score notebooks.

###  Work Queues View
<a name=work_queues_view"></a>

Using `Work queues view`  is another way to identify assets in trouble or need your attention so that you can take an 
action to ensure KPIs are able to be calculated and to avoid asset unplanned downtime and be more proactive in maintenance
planning.

There are a number of `Work queues` included with Health and Predict. Here are some example `Work queues`

- Predict assets with a `High probability of failure`
- Identify `Assets in poor health` 
- Identify assets with `Assets missing data`

Work queues are preconfigured views designed to help find assets that meet specific conditions.  They can be used by the
reliability engineer to systematically address each asset on the list, in turn, and “work down” the list.


!!! note "Value"
    Allows you to prioritize your work and focus to address a specific problem, like a utility, trying to avoid unplanned downtime.

!!! attention "Actions"
    Follow the action items below.

1. Hover over the left nav bar to expand it
2. Select the `Work queues` section on the left nav bar
![setup_assets](img/HPU_8.9/HPU 85.png)
3. Select `Failing Before PM` work queue
![setup_assets](img/HPU_8.9/HPU 86.png)

   

## Investigate
<a name="investigate"></a>


The `Failing before PM` work queue shows all of the assets with scores in that work queue.  As a reliability engineer at
a Utilities plant, it is critical to avoid failures.   Note that for this `Work queues`, there are several pumps and 
substation transformers that have a predicted failure before their next planned maintenance date. Two of the transformers 
are in the container that was viewed earlier.  You will select `ST_1400518` in the queue to start managing your work load 
for the day by investigating and addressing all of the assets in the work queue.  You will use the Asset Details view to 
better understand the holistic asset condition of `ST_1400518` so that you can better assess and pick a corrective action.

!!! note "Value"
    The missing data `Work queues` are useful for an reliability engineer to help identify gaps in data necessary to create health scores or predictive failure date models.


!!! attention "Actions"
    Follow the action items below.

1. Select `ST_1400518` which opens the `asset details` view.  Details on this page will vary since this is a live demonstration environment system.
![setup_assets](img/HPU_8.9/HPU 87.png)


###  Assets Detail View
<a name="assets_detail_view"></a>

On the top of the `Asset Details` page there are the resulting scores from the predefined notebook for this substation 
transformer.  These are health, criticality, risk, end of life and effective age score.  Note that effective age is a 
calculation using the actual age and the health score.  An asset in poor health will have an effective age greater than 
its actual age.

On the second line, there are custom scores, like the `Substation Efficiency` score.
![setup_assets](img/HPU_8.9/HPU 88.png)

The next `Preventive Maintenance` date and the `MRR` come directly from Maximo Manage.

!!! note "Value"
    The asset detail page is an useful for investigating assets.  Asset condition information is presented on a single page, in easy-to-read tables, charts and graphs.

- On the top of the page, there are details about the asset, and KPIs that give a snapshot of its current state.
- For this asset, there is a `Health Score` of 44, which is in the medium `fair` zone.  
- This asset also has a high `Criticality` and low `Risk Score`. 
- This asset has a low percentage of `probability` that there will be an imminent `failure`, based on the `Installation Date` and manufacturers recommended life.
- The asset is projected to fail in the next 0 days, but the next maintenance isn't planned for 30 days.


At the beginning of the investigation, you suspected the asset was going to fail before its planned maintenance.  But, just by 
looking at the KPIs, additional evidence suggests that this asset may be in trouble, and that some action needs to be 
taken now.  The `Health history` widget of this asset is below the `Score widget`. Using the historical health chart, you can see 
this assets health has been low for some time.  This is another indication that this asset needs attention.


!!! note "Value"
    Viewing the contributors and the historical health scores can give insight into the why a particular score is trending in one direction or the other.


!!! attention "Actions"
    Follow the action items below.


1. Scroll down the page to learn more about the health of the asset, go to the `Score details` widget. 
![setup_assets](img/HPU_8.9/HPU 89.png)
2. Understand what is contributing to the poor health of the asset to see how you might address the problems.  
3. Expand the view to see the contributors by clicking the `chevrons` to view the contributors to poor asset health. 
![setup_assets](img/hpu_8.11/chevron.png)
4. See and sort on complete list of contributors to help understand what might be the root cause of the problem.  Click `Weight` to understand what is contributing the most to the  `Score`
5. From the `Scoring` drop down box you can also see other `Custom score` contributors that you have created using the custom score template.


The Health application supports asset-specific calculations and visualizations like `Dissolved gas analysis` for transformers. 
There a two types of visualization widgets available to understand the transformers gas conditions using inspection or 
sensor data readings.

!!! note "Value"
    Understanding gas levels can be a early indicator of underlying asset transformer problems that if not inspected or serviced could result in an unscheduled maintenance or failure. 


!!! attention "Actions"
    Follow the action items below.

1. Scroll down the `Asset Details` page until you reach the `Dissolved gas analysis` tile.
![setup_assets](img/HPU_8.9/HPU 90.png)
2. Click on each of the `dots` to get detailed information about the amount of those types of gases.
3. Click the `switcher` icon on the top right corner of the tile, to view the results in the table view.
4. The other widget is the history of combustible gas concentrations. It shows the combustible gas trend and rating over 
time.  The rating represents the average acceptability of detected gas concentrations. The rating is determined by the 
overall factor.  
5. Hover on each of the assessment dates to get the detailed asset condition information.


There are several predictive model templates that come with Predict.  Your data scientist has trained and deployed these 
models built using Cloud Pack for Data and Watson Studio which is included with Maximo Application Suite.  IBM Predict 
includes templates to:

- Predict days to failure
- Calculate probability of failure
- Detect anomalies
- Generate an asset life curve based on group asset deployment and decommission dates 

These templates include a large number of algorithms and can automatically select the one that best fits the data for the 
optimal outcome.  These models are built to detect specific problems for each asset problem and failure mode.  They can 
detect problems and forecast the future condition of the asset using historical asset sensor data ingested by Maximo 
Asset Monitor or streamed into Health using the App Connect included with Maximo Application Suite. 


!!! note "Value"
    Understanding what potential problems may occur in the future allows you to schedule asset maintenance or replacement without impacting customer service or production. 


!!! attention "Actions"
    Follow the action items below.

1. Scroll down `Asset Details` page until you reach the `Predictions` tile. 
2. Double click the " the `Predictions` tile tile to expand the tile and see the prediction cards.
![setup_assets](img/HPU_8.9/HPU 91.png)

   
Note that also included with MAS is Watson Studio and Watson Machine Learning, both of which a Data Scientist can use for 
building, training, and maintaining predictive models.  In the case of this asset, the model tells us that it is projected 
to fail in 0 days plus or minus 1 day. 


A Data Scientist can build predictive models for specific failure modes using the templates included with Predict if you have failure history data. 

The reliability engineer can select those failure modes within the card to see the projection for each failure modes. 

The failure training data is used to help calculate Failure probability.  Different failure modes can be calculated and do impact predictions. 

`Failure probability` is the chance that an asset may have a failure with a certain time period.   For this asset there is a 20% probability of failure in the next 2 months due to overheating. 


A Data Scientist must build specific models for time periods just like the failure modes. You can see the prediction results by making different selections within the card.

`Failure probability history` shows how the probability of failure for each mode and how it has changed over time.

The `Factors that contribute to failure` show which factors from the training data impacted failures the most, giving an indication of what may lead to future failures.
The anomaly detection model creates a threshold based on history and shows when the asset exceeds that threshold in the card.

The `End of life curve` is built based on training data for assets that have been decommissioned.   By applying the effective age calculation from the notebook, this curve can be used to estimate probability of an end of life failure.

The `Effective age` of the transformer is 27 years.  The curve produces an end of life probability of  89%.  This is one more indication that this asset needs to be attended to immediately.


!!! note "Value"
    Understanding this asset `Effective age` and `End of life curve` relative to all the assets, allows you to understand it's likely remaining life given given it's operation and conditional history rather instead of it's calender based age. 

!!! attention "Actions"
    Follow the action items below.

1. Hover near the point where the `Effective age` crosses the curve.  
2. How is this asset performing relative to others of a similar class and where it should be for it's age?


The `Asset timeline` card shows several pieces of key information about the asset in the same graph. For example, the timeline shows a predicted failure (on the top line of the graph), that will occur before the next preventive maintenance (on the second line of the graph). 
![setup_assets](img/HPU_8.9/HPU 92.png)

!!! note "Value"
    Information on the `Asset timeline` chart, like past work orders and inspection, provide valuable insight into the asset's history, and may help you better formulate what kind of action to take.

!!! attention "Actions"
    Follow the action items below.

1. Scroll down the page
2. Hover over a point on the timeline

There are several other sections on this page including:

- `Operational status`, showing recent meter readings, maintenance history, showing work orders for this asset.
- `Replacement planning`, showing any replacement or refurbishment plans created for this particular asset.

!!! note "Value"
    While each piece of information, or card, gives nsight into the state of our asset, all of the information together, gives a richer view, and helps make a data-driven decision on how to address this asset.

- `Add flag` which sets a replacement flag on this asset to make sure it is marked to be replaced in the next round of replacement planning.
- `Create a plan` to replace or repair this asset.
- `Recalculate scores` if there is new information or your scoring notebook has changed, you can request that the scores be re-calculated to reflect these changes.
- `Edit source asset record` to navigate to the asset record to make asset changes.  In this case, possibly adjust the preventative maintenance schedule.
- `Create a service request`so that a technician can do asset repairs, inspection or replacement.


However, this asset needs urgent maintenance.  Create an emergency maintenance work order for this asset by selecting the `Create work order` option and completing the form.

Health and Predict gives many options to identify assets at risk with a table, map, chart and asset details views.

Additionally you can use and predefined `Work Queues` to help systematically address risky assets exhibiting the same 
problems or that are missing data in order to calculate their scores.

There’s a single page from which to conduct an investigation and take an action.  In this case, submitting an emergency work order to prevent the imminent failure of a substation transformer.

In Health and Predict – Utilities, there’s also the ability to use a matrix (custom or OOTB) and do long-term replacement planning based on risk tolerance and available budget.

 

### Identify / Investigate with a Matrix

Start building an investment project from the matrix view.

!!! attention "Actions"
    Follow the action items below.

1. Hover over the left nav bar to expand it
2. Select the `Assets` section on the left nav bar
![setup_assets](img/HPU_8.9/HPU 29.png)
3. Make sure the asset view is for `substation transformers` by either using the filter symbol or a saved view.  If necessary, clear the filters to start from the full set of assets under management
4. Click the “Matrix” icon to move to the matrix view
![setup_assets](img/HPU_8.9/HPU 44.png)

The default matrix view, in this case, is set to “Substation Efficiency and Health”.  This is a custom matrix.  The out-of-the-box matrices are…
- Criticality and End of life
- Criticality and Health
- Criticality and Risk

This custom matrix is using the Health score generated by using the notebook for substation transformers.  The Substation Efficiency score is a custom score.  Together, on the matrix, they can represent a proxy for sustainability.

!!! note "Value"
    Seeing how the assets are distributed by color, and against two variables, provides an easy way to identify assets at risk.

To get a different view of the assets, change the axes of the matrix by using the pull-down menu. 

The color pattern can also be adjusted by clicking on the setting cog.  By doing this, we are adjusting our risk tolerance.

!!! note "Value"
    The ability to change the matrix, further allows you to focus on specific assets.

!!! attention "Actions"
    Follow the action items below.

1. Click on the pull-down menu to show the other matrix options

3. Click `Close` to return to the matrix view
![setup_assets](img/HPU_8.9/HPU 103.png)

This view shows that there are 35 assets in red or high category.  Click through the summary boxes, or the boxes in the matrix, to see the details of the assets in a table view.

This table view provides a perfect example of how assets can be added to a new or existing investment project.

!!! note "Value"
    The ability to drill-down allows you to focus on those asset in trouble, and take action on only those assets.

!!! attention "Actions"
    Follow the action items below.
    
1. Click on the "High" box with 35 assets in it
![setup_assets](img/HPU_8.9/HPU 97.png)
2. From the table view, demonstrate how all of the assets can be selected by clicking on the selection box at the top
![setup_assets](img/HPU_8.9/HPU 98.png)
3. Show the options to add the assets to a new or existing investment project
4. Click `Cancel`

### Take Action with AIO

In Health and Predict – Utilities, there’s a capability to build an Asset Investment Optimizer (AIO) project.

The AIO process starts with building a project of assets, assigning a length and starting date to the project, then running multiple strategies to determine which assets should be replaced over the life of the project, and when.

!!! note "Value"
    Utilizing advanced data-driven analytics to optimize OPEX and CAPEX comprehensively from various dimensions.

In this case, a project has already been built with the 35 assets in the “red” cell, and the 26 assets in the “yellow” cell next to it.

![setup_assets](img/HPU_8.9/HPU 104.png)

!!! attention "Actions"
    Follow the action items below.

1. Hover over the left nav bar to expand it
2. Select the `Asset investment optimizer` section on the left nav bar

3. From the `Projects` tab, click on `ST Investment Project`
![setup_assets](img/HPU_8.9/HPU 105.png)

There are 3 strategies built out in the “ST Investment Project”.

The first strategy is to maintain the average risk of 8.2 for the 61 substation transformers in the 25-year project.

The second is to reduce the risk to 7.0.

The third is to stay within a $2.16M budget.

Each of the scenarios uses a plan template build for Substation Transformers specific replacement costs and cost of a failure.

!!! note "Value" 
    Multiple scenario can be run to determine the best strategy to meet the risk tolerance of the enterprise, and the budget available for the project.

!!! attention "Actions"
    Follow the action items below.

## Summary
<a name="summary"></a>

As the Reliability Engineer, maintaining the grid, I was able to use IBM Maximo Health and Predict to identify assets at 
risk, investigate those assets, and finally take an action to prevent a failure and unplanned downtown…saving thousands 
of dollars, and maintaining the integrity of the grid.

My actions will also help short, medium and long term investment decisions that drive maintenance and replacement policies.
