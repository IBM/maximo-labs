The table displays the following columns:

* Timestamp â€“ The time when the alert was generated.
* Name â€“ The name of the alert.
* Source â€“ Indicates the source (device or asset or other hierarchy level i.e site, system, location) that triggered the alert. Clicking on the source will redirect you to the corresponding source detail page.
* Owner â€“ Allows you to assign an owner to the alert.
* Severity â€“ Indicates the severity level of the alert.
* Status â€“ Defaults to New, but can be updated to Validated, Acknowledged, or Resolved.
* Service Request â€“ Clicking "Create Service Request" opens a popup to initiate a request in Manage.
