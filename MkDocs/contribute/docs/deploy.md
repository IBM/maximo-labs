# Deploy to Github Pages

This part of the contribution is performed by the repository administrators.</br>
Contact one of them to accept your Pull Request and then they will perform the build and deploy.

Build the site locally from the `main` branch after accepting a Pull Request:

    cd ~/Git-Repos/maximo-labs
    ./build_all_mkdocs.sh
 
Once the build is complete, verify the changes works as expected - then press `Ctrl-C` to get back to the prompt.</br>

The site directory contains the complete MKdocs build. This has to be pushed to the `gh-pages` branch with the following command:
 
    ghp-import -po site


Further information about ghp-import, can be found here: [https://pypi.org/project/ghp-import/](https://pypi.org/project/ghp-import/){target=_blank}
