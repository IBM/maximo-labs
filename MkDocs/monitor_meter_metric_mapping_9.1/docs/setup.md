3. Refer to the [Asset section above](#setup-metermetric-mappings-for-assets) and continue from Step 3 to complete the process. Practice the process on your own.

## Accessing Meter/Metrics Mappings

You can view all meter-to-metric associations in a centralized location. To access them, follow the steps below:

1. Navigate to the **Meter Mappings** page from side menu bar ( **Monitor â†’ Setup â†’ Meter Mappings** )
