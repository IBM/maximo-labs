Click on `About` in the upper right hand corner:</br>
![Select About](img/mas_update_01.png)</br></br>

In this case it was a MAS 9.0.0:</br>
![About](img/mas_update_02.png)</br></br>

Now we need to figure out what MAS 9.0 OpenShift catalog was used and if a newer one is available.</br>
First open a terminal and run the docker command to start the MAS CLI docker container:
````
docker run -ti --rm --pull always quay.io/ibmmas/cli
````
</br>

Login to the OpenShift cluster using your kubeadmin account and click on `Copy login command`:</br>

Click on `Display Token` and copy the `oc login` command in its entirety:</br>
![OCP Login Command](img/mas_update_05.png)</br></br>

Run the command in the MAS CLI docker:</br>
![MAS CLI](img/mas_update_06.png)</br></br>

Now the MAS CLI docker is authenticated against your OCP cluster. Execute `mas update` and enter `y` to proceed with this cluster.</br>
Notice the Maximo Operator Catalog that has been used - in this case `v9-240625-amd64` which is MAS 9.0.0.</br>
Also notice that newer versions are available:</br>

Press `Enter` to select the default value, i.e. 1.</br>
Step 5) Dependency Update Checks will be performed. 

!!! tip
    If the Dependency Update Check "hangs" then just rerun it in another window.</br> 

Select `y` to confirm update of MongoDb and select `y` to proceed with these settings:</br>
