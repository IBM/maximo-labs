# Welcome to the IBM Maximo Monitor 9.1</br>Hierarchy Lab

!!! info
    This Lab demonstrates how to setup hierarchy from manage and sync in Monitor.

You will learn about Maximo's capabilities to:

* Create an Organization
* Activate Organization
* Create Site 
* Create Location, System
* Create Asset and Assign LocationÂ 
* Create Device-Type & Device in Monitor
* Assign Devices using csv
* Hierarchy View

Monitor is now integrated with Manage, enabling seamless synchronization between the two platforms for better operational efficiency.

Hierarchies are imported directly from Manage, eliminating the need for manual CSV uploads and simplifying the setup process.

Organization activation now requires cost-centre details to be entered in Manage, ensuring financial alignment and accountability from the outset.

Once organizations are activated in Manage, they automatically appear in Monitor under the Hierarchy section, reflecting their structure and relationships.

All hierarchy levels including Location, System, Asset, Site, and Organization are created and managed within Manage, centralizing control and consistency.

Devices and their types are created in Monitor, allowing for detailed tracking and monitoring of physical equipment.

Devices can only be assigned or unassigned to assets and locations, ensuring a focused and structured deployment within the hierarchy.
