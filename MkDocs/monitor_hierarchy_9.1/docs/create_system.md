!!! info

    A system is a group of locations that is organized into a logical hierarchy of parent and child locations to help you track assets and manage work more effectively.</br>

    You can use systems to categorize the use or physical qualities of locations and to build a hierarchy of locations within a site. For example, a system can represent a group of buildings at a site or even the whole site.</br>

    A site can have multiple systems, but one system in the site must be designated as the primary system. The first system that is associated with a site is automatically the primary system, but you can designate a different system as the primary system if necessary. The primary system must be hierarchical, meaning that there is a parent-child relationship between each location in the system.</br>

1. In the Manage Assets Work Center, select the Places(Location/Asset) page.

2. Select the Manage Systems tab and select Add system.

* Optional: To make the system that you added the primary system for the site, edit the row for that system and specify Y in the Primary System column.
