## Unassign Device
!!! note "Note"
     We can archive device type only when devices of this device type are not assigned to any asset or location.

To unassign a device from an Asset or Location, search for the relevant device type and select the device that was previously assigned to the Asset or Location.</br>
Navigate to the Device Overview page. Under the 'Relationships' section, if the device is assigned to an Asset, click the delete icon corresponding to each row to remove the assignment.
