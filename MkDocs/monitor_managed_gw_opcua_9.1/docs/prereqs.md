# Exercise 1 and 4

Docker must be running on your local machine while acting as the Managed Gateway instance.</br>
There are different ways to install the Docker engine depending of the package and the OS.</br>
One multi platform option is Rancher Desktop. It is fairly easy to install Rancher Desktop,</br>
as you just have to follow this guide: [Running Docker locally](https://docs.rancherdesktop.io/getting-started/installation/){target=_blank}</br>

!!! tip
    Podman and Docker Desktop should also work, but I have not tested it.
