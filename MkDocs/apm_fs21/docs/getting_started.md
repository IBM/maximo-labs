# Getting Started with the IBM Maximo Monitor, Health and Predict Overview Lab!
 
Students doing the demo in this lab should have been provided access to Maximo Application Suite v8.2 instance by /
the Lab Facilitator.  

Preparing for delivering the demo should read the [instructions](../prereqs).

See [Contributing to Labs](../../about) if you are interested in providing feedback by submitting enhancements or bugs.  We also 
welcome your contributions to existing or new exercises. 

## Story

A Water Resource Authority needs to manage water and wastewater treatment across multiple cities and regions from a single application.  Remote operational support engineers need a single dashboard to manage sites and assets.  Reliability Engineers need to understand their asset health and prevent predicted failures by properly servicing their rotating assets like centrifugal pumps.

## Personas

•	Remote Operational Support<br>
•	Maintenance Supervisor<br>
•	Technician<br>
•	Reliability Engineer

## Overview

<b>Monitor:</b><br>
<br>
•	Monitor - Operational support sees high anomalies on vibration Pump 005 of 100s of pumps at scale.<br>
•	Monitor - Operational support reviews asset history and service recently done to replace the seals to address vibration. <br>
•	Monitor - Operational support reviews Anomaly function and alert thresholds.<br>
•	Monitor - Operational support opens Service requests to look at vibration x - Pump 005.<br>
<br>
<b>Manage:</b><br>
<br>
•	Manage - Maintenance supervisor gets a service request that generates a work order to determine the cause of the vibration. <br>
•	Manage - Technician executes the WO and after finding the loose mounting, fixes it, adds comments, and closes the WO<br>
<br>
<b>Health:</b><br>
<br>
•	Health - Reliability engineer views the assets in the grid view, adds status column, filters to pumps only.<br>
•	Health - Reliability engineer views work queue "assets with failure predicted before PM", and filters the queue to just the pumps.<br>
<br>
<b>Health/Predict:</b><br>
<br>
•	Health/Predict - Reliability engineer selects PUMP 005 that is also under performing and is predicted to fail before the next scheduled PM.<br>
•	Health/Predict - Reliability engineer reviews asset detail page and asset timeline.
