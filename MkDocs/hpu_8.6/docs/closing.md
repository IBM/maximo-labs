<h1>CLOSING REMARKS</h1> 

- In summary, we have been able to work as the Reliability Engineer to maintain the health of the grid using Maximo Application Suite Health and Predict for Utilities. We identified assets at risk, investigated those assets, and finally took action to prevent a failure and unplanned downtime.
- Our visibility into asset health and use of predictive data analytics has saved us thousands of dollars and has maintained the integrity of the grid. 
- Our actions will also help short, medium, and long term investment decisions by basing these plans in actual data and relevant asset information. This will drive maintenance and replacement policies moving forward. 
- Maximo Application Suite for Utilities is tailored to combine Utilities industry expertise with the most robust EAM software on the market. 
- Thank you so much for following along this lab.
