# Pre-Requisite Instructions

Here are the pre-requisites for the exercises in this lab. 

!!! attention
    This lab requires an instance of MAS 9.0 or later with at least MAS Core installed.</br>



# All Exercises

All Exercises require that you have:

1.  A computer with a Chrome or Firefox browser and internet connectivity.</br></br>

2.  Access to login to an OpenShift cluster using kubeadmin with at least MAS Core installed.</br>
Which could be the result from running the [MAS Techzone Certified Base Image Hands-on Lab](../../mas_techzone_base).</br></br>

3.  Docker must be running on your local machine while using MAS CLI</br>
One multi platform option is Rancher Desktop. It is fairly easy to install Rancher Desktop,</br>
as you just have to follow this guide: [Running Docker locally](https://docs.rancherdesktop.io/getting-started/installation/){target=_blank}</br>
!!! tip
    Podman and Docker Desktop should also work, but I have not tested it.
