<h1>CLOSING REMARKS</h1> 

- In our end-to-end journey, we’ve seen our Remote Operations Support Engineer get a view of the sedimentation tanks with MVI, using a model that the Asset Analyst and the Asset Manager downloaded from the Digital Twin Exchange. 

- The Engineer also monitored all of the enterprise’s pumps in near-real time, applyingAI anomaly detection to eliminate false positive alerts. They investigated an asset in trouble, and submitted a service request all from a set of dashboardsin Maximo Monitor. 

- We talked about how our supervisor may create a work order in Maximo Manage for our technician, or it can be automatically generated.  And, that technician used Maximo Mobile to remotely complete the w/o, and received AI assistance with Maximo Assist and Parts Identifier. 

- When our technician had a man-down situation, our Safety Officer was able to detect the problem, communicate with the technician, provide assistance, and ultimately identify the root cause of the problem with Maximo Safety. 

- And finally, our Reliability Engineer continued the investigation, using Maximo Health and Predict to better understand the current and future states of the pumps, identify potential problems, and take actions using AI-driven insights to avoid unplanned downtime. 

All of these applications are delivered in the Maximo Application Suite and can address any, or all, of the roles we discussed today.
