# Objectives
In this Exercise you will learn how to add a device to the Device library.

---
*Before you begin:*  
This Exercise requires that you have:

1. completed the pre-requisites required for [all labs](prereqs.md)
2. completed the previous exercises

Since PLC's are very customizable you will need to add a new device to the Device library instead of using a pre-configured device in the Device library, like a Variable frequency Drive communicating over Modbus.</br>

Navigate to the Device library setup page:</br>

For OPC UA devices it is possible to either upload a device configuration or to use the built-in data tag autodetection functionality which is a lot easier.</br>
Select `Add device to library` and the menu item `Scan for devices`:</br>

Select the OPC-UA protocol:</br>

Enter the device details and scroll down:</br>

Copy the Device scan command and don't click `Done` just yet:</br>

Open a terminal window (Mac/Linux) or Command window (Windows) and run the Device scan command:</br>

Wait until it has finalized and returned to the command prompt.</br>
The new device has now been added to the Device library.</br>

Go back to the browser, click `Done`and then `Leave page`:</br>
![Scan for devices end](img/add_device_08.png)</br></br>

Search for your new device in the Device library:</br>
![Scan for devices result](img/add_device_09.png)</br></br>

Click on your new device to see the metrics (data tags) that was added to this device:</br>

Click on `Cancel` once you are done looking at these beautiful data tags ðŸ¤—.</br>

Congratulations you have successfully added a device to the Device library.</br>
