<h2>Exercise 2.3 - Fail/Pass Rate Dashboard Configuration</h2>

Now that we have created an inspection and inspected a couple cans, we can get real-time data on how our production line is doing. 

1. Go back to the MVI app and click `Dashboard` at the bottom.

2. Click on the three dots by `No Project Selected`.

    <br>

3. Then Select `Project`.

    <br>

4. Click on the Project you created in Exercise 1.3, then select `Dataset`.

 <h4>Congratulations, you have completed Exercise 2!</h4>

You have created and conducted an inspection on aluminum cans for a manufacturing line. You are also able to draw insights with a real-time Pass/Fail Rate Dashboard on how your manufacturing line is doing.
