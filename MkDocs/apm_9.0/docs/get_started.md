# Get Started
In this Lab you wil learn how to use Maximo Health and Predict capabilities to manage the reliability, condition and 
performance of your assets.  

The version of Health and Predict used in this Lab is for Maximo Application Suite v8.11 early program.  
This lab also utilizes the Maximo Models for Electrical Distribution.

## Description

Maximo Manage includes the ability to manage assets.  Reliability Engineers can use asset data stored in Manage and other 
data sources to better plan their asset maintenance and repairs to ensure asset reliability, reduce operational risks and 
extend asset life.  By leveraging asset health scoring and AI algorithms to detect anomalies and predict asset failures, 
reliability enginers can action assets in time to mitigate or avoid their negative impacts. 

The intended audience for this lab are reliability engineers and data scientists who will set up and use the Maximo 
Environment to:
    -  Analyze their asset dats.
    -  Understand and investigate the condition of their assets.
    -  Identify and implement the best corrective actions to resolve asset problems.

Health and Predict includes proven  machine learning model templates to make predictions or classify asset condition 
using asset data.  These lab exercises provide you the best practices and guided instructions for how to use Health and 
Predict to set up and asses your asset condition scoring. Using the Matrix, Charts, Maps and Asset Grid page, you can 
investigate at risk or poor health assets.  Finally you can action those assets using the Asset Investment optimization 
capability to identify the best resolution maintain budget, maintain risk or reduce risk.


**Pre-requisites**

For this exercise ensure you have access to :

- MAS v8.11 early program environment Health and Predict applications which includes the Maximo Models for Electrical Distribution accelerator.  
- Cloud Pak for Data Watson Studio compatible with MAS v8.11
- Enabled Maximo Schedule Optimization, so that you can use Asset Investment Optimization capability included with Health.
