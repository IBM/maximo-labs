## Setup Default Health Asset Condition Scores
<a name="default_score"></a>

Maximo Health v9 includes the ability to automatically active Asset Condition scoring for all assets that don't belong to
a score group.  After you activate the default asset condition scores, any new asset you create will also use 
the out of the box default score group to calculate asset condition for Health Risk and Criticality.   Asset that are 
already part of score group will be skipped.

Watch the [video on Default Asset Condition Scores](https://mediacenter.ibm.com/media/1_2k8jqivj)

### Activate the Default Score

In this exercise you enable the `Default Score`. 

1. After you Log into IBM Maximo for the first time you will be reminded to enable the `Default Score`. 
2. Press the `Activate` Button to enable the Default Scores.
![default_scores_form](../../../maximo-labs/apm_9.0/img/default_scores_form.png)
3. Make sure you have create assets and they have the required dependencies set.  An Asset Priority,  Work orders or 
Service Requests set against the asset.  Asset installation date and asset expected life based on Manufacture.
4. Optionally you can choose to `activate the scores later`.  Go to `Setting Group` and `Groups` tab to find the 
`Default_Score` group to enable it.
5. Check the group to see if the default scores have been activated.  You will see Health, Risk and Criticality 
calculated for all your assets.
![default_scores_group](../../../maximo-labs/apm_9.0/img/defaultscores_activated.png)

Asset scores will begin to be calculated using the `Default_Score` group.  You can also verify if the scoring is working by
viewing assets using the `Asset Table List` page.  If the Health, Risk ad Criticality score don't apper it likely because
there data missing for it to be calculated.   You can bulk update missing data for Installation Date in the `Asset Table 
List` page simply by clicking on the column and row asset value and entering the information in the pop up dialog.   
You can also view the Asset Condition Scores for `Health`, `Risk` and `Criticality` on the `Asset Details` page.

## Create an Asset
<a name="create_asset"></a>

In this exercise you create an asset in IBM Maximo Manage.  You will use this asset later to measure it's Meantime 
Between Failure and see how it's value performs versus other assets using a Chart. 

In order for the Meantime Between Failure Score to be calculated you also are required also create an unscheduled emergency work 
order.   Let's start by first creating the asset and then a work order.

To create an example asset for Meantime Between Failure score make sure you enter the following asset fields:

- Asset Number: "AH016"
- Description: "Submersible pump 20 hp rotary"
- Asset Type: "Pump"
- Status: Active
- Installation Date: 6/1/20
- Expected Life: 10  ( Manufacture suggested life - 20% for example)
- Vendor: Armstrong
- Manufacturer: Armstrong

1. Log into IBM Maximo.  Open IBM Maximo Application Suite. 
- Open your web browser and navigate to the IBM Maximo login page.
- Enter your `username` and `password` to log in.
- Launch `Manage` on the `Applications` tab.  If `Manage` tile is not present on `Applications` tab,  ask your MAS 
administrator to enable it for your user id.

2. Navigate to the `Asset` Module. Select to `Asset` Module.  From the main Maximo menu, select `Assets > Assets`.

3. Create a New Asset:

- Open `New Asset` Form. In the `Asset` module, click on the `New Asset` button to open the `asset creation` form.

4. Fill in Asset Details:

- Enter `Asset Number`. In the `Asset Number` field, enter a unique identifier for the asset (e.g., AH016).
- Enter `Description`.  In the `Description` field, enter a detailed description of the asset (e.g., Submersible pump 20 hp rotary).
- Select `Asset Type`. Locate the `Asset Type` field and select the appropriate type from the dropdown menu (e.g., Pump).
- Enter `Installation Date`. Enter the `date` the asset was installed. Use the date picker to select the date (e.g., 2024-05-21).
- Enter `Vendor Information`. In the `Vendor` field, enter the name of the vendor from which the asset was purchased (e.g., Siemens).
- Enter `Manufacturer Information`. In the `Manufacturer` field, enter the name of the manufacturer of the asset (e.g., ABB).
- Enter `Expected Life` in Years. In the `Expected Life` field, enter the expected operational life of the asset in years (e.g., 20).

5. Save the `Asset`. After filling in all the required fields, click the `Save` button to create the asset record in Maximo.

- Click `Save` to store the new asset record.

6. Select  the asset status to `Active`:

- From the `Common Actions` menu on the left, find the `Status` menu to launch the status Form.
![change_asset_status](../../../maximo-labs/apm_9.0/img/change_asset_status.png)
- Choose  `Active` from the `New Status` dropdown menu and click `Save` button.
![change_asset_status](../../../maximo-labs/apm_9.0/img/change_asset_status.png)

##  Setup Health Score Groups
<a name="setup_health_score_group"></a>

When you first login to the Health Application,  there is a universal table list view of all managed assets.

Scores that are shown in this view, and others, are created from the `Scoring Settings` section on the left nav bar.

1. Hover over the left nav bar to expand it. Select the `Scoring Settings` section on the left nav bar
![setup_settings menu](../../../maximo-labs/apm_9.0/img/score_settings.png)	

2. Create a scoring group by choosing assets that have similar behavior.  `Groups` are bound to an `asset query`. 

If there are any scoring groups already created, they will appear on the `Groups` tab of the `Scoring settings` page.

3. Scroll through the pages to see what groups have already been created.
![setup_assets](../../../maximo-labs/apm_8.9/img/HPU_8.9/HPU 5.png)

There are 2 ways to create asset condition scores in Maximo Health. The first way is using the [Maximo Formula Engine]( ).  
The second way is use Watson Studio to customize the Jupyter notebook templates provided in Maximo Health or accelerators . 
Each asset class has it's own notebook template.  See the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/mhmpmh-and-p-u/continuous-delivery?topic=cm-asset-class-notebooks-in-maximo-health-predict-utilities">documentation</a> 
for the list of asset classes IBM provides.  You can configure the `Score Settings` using a text file with a `.cfg` 
extension to specify how to calculate Asset Health, Risk and Criticality.

Alternatively, scoring methodologies can be created from scratch directly in the UI.

## Meantime Between Failure
<a name="mtbf"></a>

To calculate the count of how many assets are achieving or not achieving the meantime to failure requires that you 
specify threshold goal to achieve.   For example what is the number of hours an asset needs to go to achieve the meantime 
of failure goal.  Assets who have a meantime between failure less than the number of hours means they are failing earlier 
than required and therefore aren't meeting the meantime between failure.   Meantime between failures is calculated using
the amount of time an asset goes before it has an unscheduled work order.  Where the work order is either a corrective 
maintenance or emergency maintenance.   The meantime between failure is calculated by summing the total amount of time 
between installation and the first and subsequent unscheduled work order divided by the total number of unscheduled 
worker order occurrences.

### Create Threshold on Charts Page

To create a meantime between failure threshold consider the group of assets that you are measuring performance for.
Consider creating separate thresholds for a groups of similar expected performance assets within an asset class like 
pumps and other thresholds for assets that are part of a system and require similar performance considerations like an
HVAC system.  

For this exercise you will create a MTBF performance threshold for an asset class. You can use pumps that have a similar 
asset class, type, manufacture and model.  There are two ways to create `Thresholds`.  One is on the `Asset Charts` page,

If you haven't previously created any `Thresholds`. The other way to create them by going to the `Score Settings` page.

1. Navigate to the `Asset Charts` page. 
![setup_settings menu](../../../maximo-labs/apm_9.0/img/GoToChartsCreateThreshold.png)	
2. Click `Create threshold` button.
3. Fill in the form values and click the `Save` button.
![setup_settings menu](../../../maximo-labs/apm_9.0/img/CreateThresholdPumpHours.png)
4. Select the `box` at the top of the page to select all of the assets on the table. 
![setup_assets](../../../maximo-labs/apm_8.9/img/HPU_8.9/HPU 53.png)
5. Select `Create investment project`. 
![setup_assets](../../../maximo-labs/apm_8.9/img/HPU_8.9/HPU 54.png)


### Create Threshold on Score Settings Page

 Create a `Threshold` anytime by navigating to the `Score Settings`  After you create the threshold it will be made
 available as an option on `MTBF` chart on the `Charts` page.

1. Navigate to the `Score Setting` page. 
![setup_settings menu](../../../maximo-labs/apm_9.0/img/ClickOnFilterFunnelIcon.png)	
2. Click `Funnel` button.
3. Select the previously created Threshold you want to use for the current `View` and click the `Save` button.
![setup_settings menu](../../../maximo-labs/apm_9.0/img/CreateThresholdPumpHours.png)


 The other way to create them by going to the `Score Settings` page.

1. Navigate to the `Asset Charts` page. 
![setup_settings menu](../../../maximo-labs/apm_9.0/img/GoToChartsCreateThreshold.png)	
2. Click `Create threshold` button.
3. Fill in the form values and click the `Save` button.
![setup_settings menu](../../../maximo-labs/apm_9.0/img/CreateThresholdPumpHours.png)
4. Select the `box` at the top of the page to select all of the assets on the table. 
![setup_assets](../../../maximo-labs/apm_8.9/img/HPU_8.9/HPU 53.png)
5. Select `Create investment project`. 
![setup_assets](../../../maximo-labs/apm_8.9/img/HPU_8.9/HPU 54.png)


### Add Required Data on Asset Details

To calculate an asset's meantime between failure (MTBF), the asset's installation date must be known. Assets that are unable to
display their MTBF value will show an `i` icon in the MTBF column and asset row in `Asset Table` Page or on the value card of 
the `Asset Details` Page.  By clicking on the `i` icon, a dialog will open where you can set the installation date.  Suggested
values for the installation date are also provided.

1. Navigate to an `Asset Details` Page
![change_asset_status](../../../maximo-labs/apm_9.0/img/asset_details_enter_installation_date.png)
2. Click the an `i` icon on the MTBF value card.  
3. Choose the installation date using the `Calendar` control inf the dialog.  If you don't know the installation date
consider using the suggested value of when the asset was first added to Maximo.  
4. Click `save` to save the installation date.
5. The MTBF value card will be updated when the MTBF calculation is recalculated in the `crontask`.

### Add Required Data on Asset Table

1. Navigate to an `Asset Table` Page
![change_asset_status](../../../maximo-labs/apm_9.0/img/asset_table_click_i_mtbf.png)
2. Click the an `i` icon on the MTBF value card.  
3. Choose the installation date using the `Calendar` control inf the dialog.  If you don't know the installation date
consider using the suggested value of when the asset was first added to Maximo.  
4. Click `save` button to save the installation date.
![change_asset_status](../../../maximo-labs/apm_9.0/img/mtbf_asset_table_enter_installation_date.png)
5. The MTBF value card will be updated when the MTBF calculation is recalculated in the `crontask`. You will see a status
message letting you know the value will be calculated.
![change_asset_status](../../../maximo-labs/apm_9.0/img/crontask_status.png)


### Troubleshoot MTBF

If an asset's MTBF value doesn't appear in the `Asset Details` page or `Asset Table` page after you have entered and the asset's installation date
and the `crontask` has run then check to see if there are any filters applied to the `crontask` that remove your asset from
the list of assets to be calculated for MTBF.

1. Navigate to the `crontask` in Manage.
![change_asset_status](../../../maximo-labs/apm_9.0/img/manage_select_crontask.png)
2. Search on `MTBF` and click on the `MTBF crontask`.
![change_asset_status](../../../maximo-labs/apm_9.0/img/search_mtbf_crontask.png)
3. Review the  `crontask parameters`  to see if the value would descope your asset from being calculated.
![change_asset_status](../../../maximo-labs/apm_9.0/img/mtbf_cron_task.png)
3. Remove or correct any filters that my descope your asset from being included in the MTBF score calculation task.
and click the `save` button to save the `crontask` settings.
