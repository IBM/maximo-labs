You can see the Product Type of the industrial device you have chosen, i.e. Variable Frequency Drives for the Lenze i550. Click on the Device type and you should see this: New in MAS 9.0 It is now possible to create your own Device types based on the Product type. The first item in the drop-down list is the default value, which was the only option in previous versions of MAS Monitor. You will create your own Device Type.

Define the Data frequency to 60000 (60 seconds) and it will automatically be used when you select the metrics: Select all the Standard Metrics. Click Save : Tip Standard metrics use labels, units, and values that are unified by the Managed Gateway once deployed. Synthesized metrics are created by using other metrics. Some standard metrics are synthesized, but those metrics are only listed as standard metrics.
