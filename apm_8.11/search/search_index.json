Please follow the steps in this task guide. Any deviation from the task guide and or changes you make to the system will also appear and may impact other users. Since this is a live system, some changes are inevitable, and you may find that some of the details of the task guide do not match the system. For this overview, the following are required, and have been created by your instructor. Capability Data Required Group (with scores) EUORG1_EUDEMO_ST_A Group (with scores) ST_EFFICIENCY Score Type Substation Efficiency Custom Matrix Efficiency and Health Investment Project ST Investment Project Plan Template SUBSTATION_TRANSFORMER If your instructor hasn't added the data, ask him to follow the steps in Build MAS Health and Predict Demonstration Introduction In this demonstration you will be a reliability engineer. Your role is to maintain the reliability of the grid. Your major responsibility is to ensure that the grid stays up and operational. You are also responsible for making short, medium and long term investment decisions that drive maintenance and replacement policies. You use asset condition and operational data to gain insights into Asset Health, Probability of Failure and Risk, both today and into the future. Thankfully you have a Health and Predict solution from IBM with advanced analytics that help you work efficiently and confidently without relying on spreadsheets or point solutions that consider 1 or 2 data sources. Health and Predict incorporates multiple data sources such as Asset Master data from Manage, Work order data, historical failure data, GeoSpatial Data, Inspection and Test Logs, IoT and Sensor data. Health and Predict provides a flexible asset condition framework for mining the asset condition data. Health and Predict helps you identify assets that are at greatest risk of failure, across different circuits/feeders, substations and regions. The risk assessment helps you drive asset and work management activities in Maximo Manage or other EAM systems to keep the grid up, reduce operational expense, optimize and defend capital expenditures resulting in better outcomes. Maximo Health and Predict are applications in Maximo Application Suite (MAS) that are targeted to the reliability engineer, and provide a view of the current state and future state of an enterprise's assets. IBM Maximo Models for Electrical Distribution is an accelerator that extends Health and Predict designed for understanding the condition of electrical distribution asset classes used by the utilities industry. Identify On the \u201cApplications\u201d tab, there are tiles for each of the applications that the admin has loaded from the Maximo Application Suite (MAS). On the \u201cIndustry Solution\u201d tab, there is a tile for Health and Predict \u2013 Utilities. Value Health and Predict arm you the reliability engineer with AI-powered insights to take actions to extend the life of the Utility\u2019s assets, reduce maintenance costs, and eliminate unplanned downtime. Actions Follow the action items below. From the main MAS page, select the Applications tab Click the Launch link Health tile. The Asset Table View is displayed with the default query of all assets. Asset Table View On the main screen, there is a table view of all managed assets in a familiar table view. From this page you can quickly choose the asset query that reflects the assets you are responsible for. You can filter those assets to quickly identify the assets that have poor scores by sorting the assets or by searching for assets using key words so that you can get the latest asset details on an individual asset. Value This is particularly valuable because it shows you a mix of both IT data (from Manage) and OT data (from Monitor) together in a single view. This asset data is coming from Maximo Manage, but MAS can connect to other EAM systems with or App Connect, via API or using Monitor Connectors. Different views of the data can be generated to make it easier to identify critical assets. On this grid, you can add and move columns, filter, search and sort. Actions Follow the action items below. Select the hamburger icon above to the magnifying glass to show the left navigation menus. This shows how you can navigate to other perspectives like locations to understand location health. There are other menu options to setup health scores, asset investment analysis or and prediction capabilities. Click hamburger menu icon again to close the menu slider. There\u2019s an option to create private views, and public views which are available to everyone. Value Saved views allow the you to return to a particular view so that they don\u2019t have to start over every time. This view filters on my Substation Transformers. Actions Use the selection box to show your saved view. Click the selection box to show the saved views then click on the Substation Transformers view. In the Table view, there are columns with calculated data. There are Health scores, which are created for groups of assets from the Scoring setting menu. These specify the group that scores are calculated on. The query the notebook to use and how frequently the score should be calculated. Value You don't have to spend time creating your own templates but can use the included notebook templates with predefined industry standard formulas to calculate health, criticality, risk, end of life and effective age scores for assets. Actions Follow the actions below You can display the data in the Table view that is most important to you. Use the selection box to choose which asset data columns to display in your table. The Days to Failure column comes from a predictive model defined and scheduled in the Predict setting tab. The IBM Maximo Models for Electrical Distribution includes the following model templates: Substation Transformers / Substation Power (IBM Transformers Tap Changers) Circuit Breaker Air Blast Circuit Breaker (IBM Circuit Breakers Air Blast) Air Magnetic Circuit Breaker Circuit Breaker Oil Circuit Breaker (IBM Circuit Breakers Oil) SF6 Circuit Breaker Vacuum Circuit Breaker Distribution Transformers (IBM Transformers Tap Changers) Overheads (multiple) Undergrounds (multiple) Instrument Transformers Dry Current Transformer Oil Filled Capacitive Voltage Transformer Oil Filled Current Transformer (IBM Instrument Oil Filled CTs) Oil Filled Voltage Transformer SF6 Filled Current Transformer Switch gear / Gas Insulated Switch gear (IBM Gas Insulated Switchgear) Map View Another view to help identify assets in trouble is the map view. Using a map view focused to a container is a good way to understand the capabilities and benefits of the Map view. Containers enable to you reflect the geolocation of your assets and geo fencing of business areas. It could be a region, town, service subscriber area you are responsible for servicing. We\u2019ll look at a region that contains a mixture of transformers, circuit breakers, cables (OTWs), and switches. Select a group of assets, or a container, that contains a mixture of transformers, circuit breakers, cables (OTWs), and switches. Value Seeing how assets are spatially distributed may assist with identifying and investigating assets at risk. This is especially true in the utilities industry that have geo location dependencies on interconnectivity, weather or area of responsibility. Actions Follow the action items below. You filter the group of assets you want to focus on. Reset the View to show All shared assets. Reference the early instructions if you forgot how to do this. Click the filter icon that looks like a funnel. Select the pencil symbol for containers Select NIXON9098 Click OK Click Apply You can see there are 261 assets in this container. When we sort by the health score from low to high, we find there are many assets with Health scores in poor health and many of them have a Criticality score of 0. This is concerning. Several column headers can be used to sort to help visualize the data in different ways. Sort by most critical assets and with the worst health. Value Be able to quickly focus on the assets you are responsible for and in need of action. Actions Follow the action items below.

Assets Detail View On the top of the Asset Details page there are the resulting scores from the predefined notebook for this substation transformer. These are health, criticality, risk, end of life and effective age score. Note that effective age is a calculation using the actual age and the health score. An asset in poor health will have an effective age greater than its actual age. On the second line, there are custom scores, like the Substation Efficiency score. The next Preventive Maintenance date and the MRR come directly from Maximo Manage. Value The asset detail page is an useful for investigating assets. Asset condition information is presented on a single page, in easy-to-read tables, charts and graphs. On the top of the page, there are details about the asset, and KPIs that give a snapshot of its current state. For this asset, there is a Health Score of 44, which is in the medium fair zone. This asset also has a high Criticality and low Risk Score . This asset has a low percentage of probability that there will be an imminent failure , based on the Installation Date and manufacturers recommended life. The asset is projected to fail in the next 0 days, but the next maintenance isn't planned for 30 days. At the beginning of the investigation, you suspected the asset was going to fail before its planned maintenance. But, just by looking at the KPIs, additional evidence suggests that this asset may be in trouble, and that some action needs to be taken now. The Health history widget of this asset is below the Score widget . Using the historical health chart, you can see this assets health has been low for some time. This is another indication that this asset needs attention. Value Viewing the contributors and the historical health scores can give insight into the why a particular score is trending in one direction or the other. Actions Follow the action items below. Scroll down the page to learn more about the health of the asset, go to the Score details widget.

These models are built to detect specific problems for each asset problem and failure mode. They can detect problems and forecast the future condition of the asset using historical asset sensor data ingested by Maximo Asset Monitor or streamed into Health using the App Connect included with Maximo Application Suite. Value Understanding what potential problems may occur in the future allows you to schedule asset maintenance or replacement without impacting customer service or production. Actions Follow the action items below. Scroll down Asset Details page until you reach the Predictions tile. Double click the \" the Predictions tile tile to expand the tile and see the prediction cards. Note that also included with MAS is Watson Studio and Watson Machine Learning, both of which a Data Scientist can use for building, training, and maintaining predictive models. In the case of this asset, the model tells us that it is projected to fail in 0 days plus or minus 1 day. A Data Scientist can build predictive models for specific failure modes using the templates included with Predict if you have failure history data. The reliability engineer can select those failure modes within the card to see the projection for each failure modes. The failure training data is used to help calculate Failure probability. Different failure modes can be calculated and do impact predictions. Failure probability is the chance that an asset may have a failure with a certain time period. For this asset there is a 20% probability of failure in the next 2 months due to overheating. A Data Scientist must build specific models for time periods just like the failure modes. You can see the prediction results by making different selections within the card. Failure probability history shows how the probability of failure for each mode and how it has changed over time. The Factors that contribute to failure show which factors from the training data impacted failures the most, giving an indication of what may lead to future failures. The anomaly detection model creates a threshold based on history and shows when the asset exceeds that threshold in the card. The End of life curve is built based on training data for assets that have been decommissioned. By applying the effective age calculation from the notebook, this curve can be used to estimate probability of an end of life failure. The Effective age of the transformer is 27 years. The curve produces an end of life probability of 89%. This is one more indication that this asset needs to be attended to immediately. Value Understanding this asset Effective age and End of life curve relative to all the assets, allows you to understand it's likely remaining life given given it's operation and conditional history rather instead of it's calender based age. Actions Follow the action items below. Hover near the point where the Effective age crosses the curve. How is this asset performing relative to others of a similar class and where it should be for it's age? The Asset timeline card shows several pieces of key information about the asset in the same graph.

These are health, criticality, risk, end of life and effective age score. Note that effective age is a calculation using the actual age and the health score. An asset in poor health will have an effective age greater than its actual age. On the second line, there are custom scores, like the Substation Efficiency score. The next Preventive Maintenance date and the MRR come directly from Maximo Manage. Value The asset detail page is an useful for investigating assets. Asset condition information is presented on a single page, in easy-to-read tables, charts and graphs. On the top of the page, there are details about the asset, and KPIs that give a snapshot of its current state. For this asset, there is a Health Score of 44, which is in the medium fair zone. This asset also has a high Criticality and low Risk Score . This asset has a low percentage of probability that there will be an imminent failure , based on the Installation Date and manufacturers recommended life. The asset is projected to fail in the next 0 days, but the next maintenance isn't planned for 30 days. At the beginning of the investigation, you suspected the asset was going to fail before its planned maintenance. But, just by looking at the KPIs, additional evidence suggests that this asset may be in trouble, and that some action needs to be taken now. The Health history widget of this asset is below the Score widget . Using the historical health chart, you can see this assets health has been low for some time. This is another indication that this asset needs attention. Value Viewing the contributors and the historical health scores can give insight into the why a particular score is trending in one direction or the other. Actions Follow the action items below. Scroll down the page to learn more about the health of the asset, go to the Score details widget. Understand what is contributing to the poor health of the asset to see how you might address the problems. Expand the view to see the contributors by clicking the chevrons to view the contributors to poor asset health. See and sort on complete list of contributors to help understand what might be the root cause of the problem. Click Weight to understand what is contributing the most to the Score From the Scoring drop down box you can also see other Custom score contributors that you have created using the custom score template. The Health application supports asset-specific calculations and visualizations like Dissolved gas analysis for transformers. There a two types of visualization widgets available to understand the transformers gas conditions using inspection or sensor data readings. Value Understanding gas levels can be a early indicator of underlying asset transformer problems that if not inspected or serviced could result in an unscheduled maintenance or failure. Actions Follow the action items below. Scroll down the Asset Details page until you reach the Dissolved gas analysis tile. Click on each of the dots to get detailed information about the amount of those types of gases. Click the switcher icon on the top right corner of the tile, to view the results in the table view. The other widget is the history of combustible gas concentrations. It shows the combustible gas trend and rating over time. The rating represents the average acceptability of detected gas concentrations. The rating is determined by the overall factor. Hover on each of the assessment dates to get the detailed asset condition information. There are several predictive model templates that come with Predict. Your data scientist has trained and deployed these models built using Cloud Pack for Data and Watson Studio which is included with Maximo Application Suite. IBM Predict includes templates to: Predict days to failure Calculate probability of failure Detect anomalies Generate an asset life curve based on group asset deployment and decommission dates These templates include a large number of algorithms and can automatically select the one that best fits the data for the optimal outcome. These models are built to detect specific problems for each asset problem and failure mode. They can detect problems and forecast the future condition of the asset using historical asset sensor data ingested by Maximo Asset Monitor or streamed into Health using the App Connect included with Maximo Application Suite. Value Understanding what potential problems may occur in the future allows you to schedule asset maintenance or replacement without impacting customer service or production. Actions Follow the action items below. Scroll down Asset Details page until you reach the Predictions tile. Double click the \" the Predictions tile tile to expand the tile and see the prediction cards. Note that also included with MAS is Watson Studio and Watson Machine Learning, both of which a Data Scientist can use for building, training, and maintaining predictive models. In the case of this asset, the model tells us that it is projected to fail in 0 days plus or minus 1 day. A Data Scientist can build predictive models for specific failure modes using the templates included with Predict if you have failure history data. The reliability engineer can select those failure modes within the card to see the projection for each failure modes. The failure training data is used to help calculate Failure probability. Different failure modes can be calculated and do impact predictions. Failure probability is the chance that an asset may have a failure with a certain time period. For this asset there is a 20% probability of failure in the next 2 months due to overheating. A Data Scientist must build specific models for time periods just like the failure modes. You can see the prediction results by making different selections within the card. Failure probability history shows how the probability of failure for each mode and how it has changed over time. The Factors that contribute to failure show which factors from the training data impacted failures the most, giving an indication of what may lead to future failures. The anomaly detection model creates a threshold based on history and shows when the asset exceeds that threshold in the card. The End of life curve is built based on training data for assets that have been decommissioned. By applying the effective age calculation from the notebook, this curve can be used to estimate probability of an end of life failure. The Effective age of the transformer is 27 years. The curve produces an end of life probability of 89%. This is one more indication that this asset needs to be attended to immediately. Value Understanding this asset Effective age and End of life curve relative to all the assets, allows you to understand it's likely remaining life given given it's operation and conditional history rather instead of it's calender based age. Actions Follow the action items below. Hover near the point where the Effective age crosses the curve. How is this asset performing relative to others of a similar class and where it should be for it's age? The Asset timeline card shows several pieces of key information about the asset in the same graph. For example, the timeline shows a predicted failure (on the top line of the graph), that will occur before the next preventive maintenance (on the second line of the graph). Value Information on the Asset timeline chart, like past work orders and inspection, provide valuable insight into the asset's history, and may help you better formulate what kind of action to take. Actions Follow the action items below. Scroll down the page Hover over a point on the timeline There are several other sections on this page including: Operational status , showing recent meter readings, maintenance history, showing work orders for this asset.
