<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>In this demonstration you will be a reliability engineer.   Your role is to maintain the reliability of the grid.  Your major 
responsibility is to ensure that the grid stays up and operational.  You are also responsible for making short, medium and 
long term investment decisions that drive maintenance and replacement policies. You use asset condition and operational 
data to gain insights into Asset Health, Probability of Failure and Risk, both today and into the future.</p>
<p>Thankfully you have a Health and Predict solution from IBM with advanced analytics that help you work efficiently and 
confidently without relying on spreadsheets or point solutions that consider 1 or 2 data sources.  Health and Predict 
incorporates multiple data sources such as <code>Asset Master</code> data from Manage, <code>Work order</code> data, historical <code>failure</code> data, <code>GeoSpatial</code> Data, 
<code>Inspection</code> and <code>Test</code> Logs, <code>IoT</code> and <code>Sensor</code> data.  Health and Predict provides a flexible asset condition framework for 
mining the asset condition data. Health and Predict helps you identify assets that are at greatest risk of failure, 
across different circuits/feeders, substations and regions. The risk assessment helps you drive asset and work management 
activities in Maximo Manage or other EAM systems to keep the grid up, reduce operational expense, optimize and defend 
capital expenditures resulting in better outcomes. </p>
<p>Maximo Health and Predict are applications in Maximo Application Suite (MAS) that are targeted to the reliability engineer, 
and provide a view of the current state and future state of an enterprise's assets.  IBM Maximo Models for Electrical 
Distribution is an accelerator that extends Health and Predict designed for understanding the condition of electrical 
distribution asset classes used by the utilities industry.</p>
<h2 id="identify">Identify</h2>
<p><a name="identify"></a></p>
<p>On the “Applications” tab, there are tiles for each of the applications that the admin has loaded from the Maximo 
Application Suite (MAS).  On the “Industry Solution” tab, there is a tile for Health and Predict – Utilities.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Value</p>
<p>Health and Predict arm you the reliability engineer with AI-powered insights to take actions to extend the life of the Utility’s assets, reduce maintenance costs, and eliminate unplanned downtime.</p>

<img alt="navigate_to_health" src="../img/hpu_8.11/assets_grid_page.png" />    </p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="asset-table-view">Asset Table View</h3>
<p><a name="grid_view"></a></p>
<p>On the main screen, there is a table view of all managed assets in a familiar table view. From this page you can quickly 
choose the asset query that reflects the assets you are responsible for. You can filter those assets to quickly identify 
the assets that have poor scores by sorting the assets or by searching for assets using key words so that you can get the 
latest asset details on an individual asset.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Value</p>
<p>This is particularly valuable because it shows you a mix of both IT data (from Manage) and OT data (from Monitor) together in a single view.</p>
</div>
<p>This asset data is coming from Maximo Manage, but MAS can connect to other EAM systems with or App Connect, via API or 
using Monitor Connectors.</p>
<p>Different views of the data can be generated to make it easier to identify critical assets.  On this grid, you can 
add and move columns, filter, search and sort.</p>
<div class="admonition attention">

from the <code>Scoring setting</code> menu. These specify the group that scores are calculated on.  The query the notebook to use and
how frequently the score should be calculated. </p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Value</p>
<p>You don't have to spend time creating your own templates but can use the included notebook templates with predefined industry standard formulas to calculate health, criticality, risk, end of life and effective age scores for assets.   </p>

<h3 id="map-view">Map View</h3>
<p><a name="map_view"></a></p>
<p>Another view to help identify assets in trouble is the map view.  Using a map view focused to a container  is a good way to
understand the capabilities and benefits of the Map view. Containers enable to you reflect the geolocation of your assets 
and geo fencing of business areas.  It could be a region, town, service subscriber area you are responsible for servicing.</p>
<p>We’ll look at a region that contains a mixture of transformers, circuit breakers, cables (OTWs), and switches. 
Select a group of assets, or a container, that contains a mixture of transformers, circuit breakers, cables (OTWs), and 
switches.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Value</p>
<p>Seeing how assets are spatially distributed may assist with identifying and investigating assets at risk.  This is especially true in the utilities industry that have geo location dependencies on interconnectivity, weather or area of responsibility.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition attention">
<p class="admonition-title">Actions</p>
<p>Follow the action items below.</p>
</div>
<ol>
<li>You filter the group of assets you want to focus on.   Reset the <code>View</code> to show <code>All shared</code> assets.  Reference the early instructions if you forgot how to do this.
<img alt="show_all_assets" src="../img/apm_8.9/show_all_assets.png" /></li>
<li>Click the <code>filter</code> icon that looks like a funnel. 
<img alt="setup_assets" src="../img/HPU_8.9/HPU%2033.png" /></li>
<li>Select the <code>pencil</code> symbol for containers
<img alt="setup_assets" src="../img/HPU_8.9/HPU%2034.png" /></li>
<li>Select  <code>NIXON9098</code></li>
<li>Click <code>OK</code>
<img alt="setup_assets" src="../img/HPU_8.9/HPU%2035.png" /></li>
<li>Click <code>Apply</code></li>
</ol>
<p><img alt="setup_assets" src="../img/HPU_8.9/HPU%2036.png" /></p>
<p>You can see there are 261 assets in this container. When we sort by the health score from low to high, we find there are 
many assets with <code>Health</code> scores in poor health and many of them have a <code>Criticality</code> score of 0.  This is concerning.  Several column headers can be used to sort to help visualize the data in different ways. Sort by most critical assets 
and with the worst health.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Value</p>
<p>Be able to quickly focus on the assets you are responsible for and in need of action.  </p>
</div>
<div class="admonition attention">
<p class="admonition-title">Actions</p>
<p>Follow the action items below.</p>
</div>
<ol>
<li>
<p>On the <code>Assets Table</code> view, click <code>Health</code> column title to sort assets by the <code>Health</code> score.<br />
<img alt="setup_assets" src="../img/HPU_8.9/HPU%2037.png" /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Asset <code>Criticality</code> can be measured by understanding the importance an asset has to the grid performing it's job of providing 
electricity to customers.   Asset <code>End of Life</code> is important to know so that assets can be planned to be replaced before they reach 
their end of life.  On the <code>Assets Table</code> view, click <code>Criticality</code> column title to sort assets by the <code>Criticality</code> score. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You need to understand the relative position of the assets with the worst health and most critical in reference to the service are you are responsible for.  </p>
<div class="admonition note">

<p>Using <code>Work queues view</code>  is another way to identify assets in trouble or need your attention so that you can take an 
action to ensure KPIs are able to be calculated and to avoid asset unplanned downtime and be more proactive in maintenance
planning.</p>
<p>There are a number of <code>Work queues</code> included with Health and Predict. Here are some example <code>Work queues</code></p>
<ul>
<li>Predict assets with a <code>High probability of failure</code></li>
<li>Identify <code>Assets in poor health</code> </li>
<li>Identify assets with <code>Assets missing data</code></li>

<p>The <code>Failing before PM</code> work queue shows all of the assets with scores in that work queue.  As a reliability engineer at
a Utilities plant, it is critical to avoid failures.   Note that for this <code>Work queues</code>, there are several pumps and 
substation transformers that have a predicted failure before their next planned maintenance date. Two of the transformers 
are in the container that was viewed earlier.  You will select <code>ST_1400518</code> in the queue to start managing your work load

<p><a name="assets_detail_view"></a></p>
<p>On the top of the <code>Asset Details</code> page there are the resulting scores from the predefined notebook for this substation 
transformer.  These are health, criticality, risk, end of life and effective age score.  Note that effective age is a 
calculation using the actual age and the health score.  An asset in poor health will have an effective age greater than 
its actual age.</p>
<p>On the second line, there are custom scores, like the <code>Substation Efficiency</code> score.

<li>On the top of the page, there are details about the asset, and KPIs that give a snapshot of its current state.</li>
<li>For this asset, there is a <code>Health Score</code> of 44, which is in the medium <code>fair</code> zone.  </li>
<li>This asset also has a high <code>Criticality</code> and low <code>Risk Score</code>. </li>
<li>This asset has a low percentage of <code>probability</code> that there will be an imminent <code>failure</code>, based on the <code>Installation Date</code> and manufacturers recommended life.</li>
<li>The asset is projected to fail in the next 0 days, but the next maintenance isn't planned for 30 days.</li>
</ul>
<p>At the beginning of the investigation, you suspected the asset was going to fail before its planned maintenance.  But, just by 
looking at the KPIs, additional evidence suggests that this asset may be in trouble, and that some action needs to be 
taken now.  The <code>Health history</code> widget of this asset is below the <code>Score widget</code>. Using the historical health chart, you can see 
this assets health has been low for some time.  This is another indication that this asset needs attention.</p>

<p>There are several predictive model templates that come with Predict.  Your data scientist has trained and deployed these 
models built using Cloud Pack for Data and Watson Studio which is included with Maximo Application Suite.  IBM Predict 
includes templates to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Predict days to failure</li>
<li>Calculate probability of failure</li>
<li>Detect anomalies</li>
<li>Generate an asset life curve based on group asset deployment and decommission dates </li>
</ul>
<p>These templates include a large number of algorithms and can automatically select the one that best fits the data for the 
optimal outcome.  These models are built to detect specific problems for each asset problem and failure mode.  They can 
detect problems and forecast the future condition of the asset using historical asset sensor data ingested by Maximo 
Asset Monitor or streamed into Health using the App Connect included with Maximo Application Suite. </p>

<p>Note that also included with MAS is Watson Studio and Watson Machine Learning, both of which a Data Scientist can use for 
building, training, and maintaining predictive models.  In the case of this asset, the model tells us that it is projected 
to fail in 0 days plus or minus 1 day. </p>
<p>A Data Scientist can build predictive models for specific failure modes using the templates included with Predict if you have failure history data. </p>
<p>The reliability engineer can select those failure modes within the card to see the projection for each failure modes. </p>
<p>The failure training data is used to help calculate Failure probability.  Different failure modes can be calculated and do impact predictions. </p>
<p><code>Failure probability</code> is the chance that an asset may have a failure with a certain time period.   For this asset there is a 20% probability of failure in the next 2 months due to overheating. </p>
<p>A Data Scientist must build specific models for time periods just like the failure modes. You can see the prediction results by making different selections within the card.</p>
<p><code>Failure probability history</code> shows how the probability of failure for each mode and how it has changed over time.</p>
<p>The <code>Factors that contribute to failure</code> show which factors from the training data impacted failures the most, giving an indication of what may lead to future failures.
The anomaly detection model creates a threshold based on history and shows when the asset exceeds that threshold in the card.</p>
<p>The <code>End of life curve</code> is built based on training data for assets that have been decommissioned.   By applying the effective age calculation from the notebook, this curve can be used to estimate probability of an end of life failure.</p>
<p>The <code>Effective age</code> of the transformer is 27 years.  The curve produces an end of life probability of  89%.  This is one more indication that this asset needs to be attended to immediately.</p>

<p>As the Reliability Engineer, maintaining the grid, I was able to use IBM Maximo Health and Predict to identify assets at
