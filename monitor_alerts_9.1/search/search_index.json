Before you begin: Make sure you have: Reviewed the Monitor Hierarchy lab to understand the concept of hierarchy in Monitor. Set up a sample hierarchy in Monitor. In this lab, an asset is configured with two devices, both running simulations. A calculated metric named asset_pressure_sum has been added at the asset level to compute the sum of pressure values from the devices every minute. In this lab, you will configure an alert at the Asset level. Similarly, alerts can be configured at any hierarchy level such as Site, System, Location, or Organization. Setup Alert Navigate to the Asset Setup page and search for the asset. click on the asset. It will open its detail page. Go to the Calculated Metrics tab and click on \"Add Calculated Metric\" button. In the popup window, search for \"Alert\". Select AlertLowValue and click \"Next\". Choose \"This node and child nodes\" and click \"Next\". Select the calculated metric for which you want to generate the alert. Enter the lower threshold, severity, and status. Click \"Next\". Provide a name for the alert and click \"Create\". The alert will now appear in the Calculated Metrics table. View Alert The pipeline will run, and an alert will be triggered when the threshold condition is met. You can view generated alerts in the \"Alerts\" dashboard, which is automatically created when an asset has any alert configured. Navigate to the Asset Dashboard view from the left sidebar. Search for the desired asset and click on it to open the details. You will see the Alerts Dashboard, which displays an Alert Table. This table lists all alerts associated with the asset and its connected devices. You can use Filter icon to filter alerts based on specific criteria. You can also create a custom dashboard using Dashboard Tab in the Asset setup page. Follow the same steps outlined in Exercise 2 of this lab series. \ud83c\udf89 Congratulations!

Before you begin: This Exercise requires that you have: Completed the prerequisites listed in the All Labs Prerequisites . Finished the previous exercises in this lab series. As seen in the previous exercise, the Alerts Dashboard includes an Alert Table that provides detailed information about each alert. The table displays the following columns: Timestamp \u2013 The time when the alert was generated. Name \u2013 The name of the alert. Source \u2013 Indicates the source (device or asset or other hierarchy level i.e site, system, location) that triggered the alert. Clicking on the source will redirect you to the corresponding source detail page. Owner \u2013 Allows you to assign an owner to the alert. Severity \u2013 Indicates the severity level of the alert. Status \u2013 Defaults to New, but can be updated to Validated, Acknowledged, or Resolved. Service Request \u2013 Clicking \"Create Service Request\" opens a popup to initiate a request in Manage. In the Create Service Request popup: Select Manage Integration. Fill in the Reported By field. The Asset and Site fields are auto-populated based on the hierarchy, if a link is found for the selected alert. You can also provide additional Location details. Default text is provided for the Summary and Details fields, which you can modify as needed. Click Create to submit the service request.

Set up a sample device type and a corresponding device. In this lab, a device type has been configured with two metrics: temperature and pressure. A sample device has also been added to this device type, and the simulator has been started. In this exercise, you will configure an Alert KPI for the device type. Alert Setup Navigate to the device type you created. click on the calculated metrics tab. Click on the \"Add calculated metrics\" button. In the search box, type \"Alert\". Select AlertHighValue from the list and click \"Select\". Choose \"All devices of this type\" and click \"Next\". Select the input item for which you want to configure the alert. Specify the threshold value, severity, and status. Click on \"Next\". Provide a name for the alert and click \"Create\". You should now see the newly created alert under the Calculated Metrics section as below. Setting up an alert at the device type level automatically applies the same alert configuration to all devices associated with that type. You will also see the same calculated metric reflected at the individual device level. You should able to see the same calculated metrics created for device as well. Pipeline will run and produce an alert after sometime when the threshold value is exceeded. Tips In this exercise, we used the AlertHighValue KPI. Similarly, you can explore other alert types such as: - AlertLowValue - AlertExpression - AlertOutOfRange. You can read more about these alert types here .
