RBAC allows administrators to precisely control which users can access specific pages and perform certain actions in the Monitor application. By assigning users to Security Groups , RBAC ensures that each user only sees and interacts with the features relevant to their role. Key Benefits of RBAC Improves security by restricting access to sensitive configurations Enhances user experience by reducing UI clutter Enables easy management of permissions using reusable Security Groups Supports real-world team roles such as admins, viewers, and operators What You Will Learn In this guide, we will cover: What Security Groups are and how to configure them How to create users and assign them to one or more groups How permissions behave when multiple groups are assigned Demonstration of different user roles (Read-only and Normal Users) Note Estimated time to complete all RBAC setup and testing steps: 15\u201320 minutes Updated: 2025-07-07","title":"Welcome"},{"location":"#welcome-to-the-maximo-monitor-91role-based-access-control-rbac-lab","text":"Info This section introduces RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) , a powerful security feature added in Maximo Monitor version 9.1.
