The Engineer also monitored all of the enterprise\u2019s pumps in near-real time, applyingAI anomaly detection to eliminate false positive alerts. They investigated an asset in trouble, and submitted a service request all from a set of dashboardsin Maximo Monitor. We talked about how our supervisor may create a work order in Maximo Manage for our technician, or it can be automatically generated. And, that technician used Maximo Mobile to remotely complete the w/o, and received AI assistance with Maximo Assist and Parts Identifier. When our technician had a man-down situation, our Safety Officer was able to detect the problem, communicate with the technician, provide assistance, and ultimately identify the root cause of the problem with Maximo Safety. And finally, our Reliability Engineer continued the investigation, using Maximo Health and Predict to better understand the current and future states of the pumps, identify potential problems, and take actions using AI-driven insights to avoid unplanned downtime. All of these applications are delivered in the Maximo Application Suite and can address any, or all, of the roles we discussed today.","title":"7. Closing"},{"location":"demo-health-predict/","text":"Health - Predict Lab Note This lab is under development. Not all steps are complete or accurate. Health Overview Now that one asset has been identified as creating multiple alerts, the Operations Manager asked the Reliability Manager to dig deeper into all of the similar pumps, to make sure that there aren't any failures predicted to occur before planned maintenance. Maximo Health and Predict are targeted to the reliability engineer. Together, they provide a view of the current state of an enterprise's assets, and project future conditions of those assets. In this exercise you will understand the Health of your assets. Select Health Application in the right corner. Show grid view of assets in health. Value: Health and Predict arm the Reliability Engineer with AI-powered insights to take actions to extend the life of the assets, reduce maintenance cost, and eliminate unplanned downtime. You can sort and select the asset attributes that allow you to rank and rate which assets you should focus on. As the Reliability Engineer, I'll identify assets the need attention, investigate those assets, and finally take an action to avoid unplanned downtime. Review Asset's Health From the main MAS screen, click on the Health tile to show grid view of assets in Maximo Health and Predict. On the main screen, I can see a universal view of my managed assets in a familiar grid view. Value: This is particularly valuable to me as the Reliability Engineer because I can see a mix of both IT data (from Manage) and OT data (from Monitor) together in a single view. These assets are coming from Maximo Manage, but we can connect to other EAM systems. Different views of our data can be generated to make it easier to identify our critical assets. On this grid, I can add and move columns, filter, search and sort. Value: You have created a saved view to so that I don\u2019t have to start over every time. This view includes a status column, filters on my pumps, and sorts them by OEM and non-OEM. In this exercise you understand how to use your saved views to quickly get to your assets based on a query and filter definition. Select \"Pump\u201d view in the demo may be different. In this view, I can see two columns with calculated data. You can see Health scores, which are created within the Health application for groups of assets from the Scoring tab. Show Health Scores under health column and Scoring Tab on the left Tab view. Value: Risk tolerance can vary among industries, asset types, and enterprises. I can define the scoring ranges specific to my tolerance levels. I can even assign my own colors. Show Predict Grouping Tab on left Tab menu. Similarly, information in the Days to Failure column comes from a predictive model from the Predict Grouping tab. Search pmpd and click Map icon. I can see that my pumps are in various states of health, but in general, my OEM pumps are in better health. Based on the information I\u2019ve received from the ops manager, I suspect that my all of my non-OEM pumps are all have issues with their o-rings. Select the map icon in the upper right of the screen. I can also see my selected assets on a map view, with similar information. Seeing how the assets are spatially distributed may assist the Reliability engineer with identify and investigating assets at risk. This is particularly true in the Utilities industry. Work Queue I\u2019ll continue my investigation to determine which assets are expect to fail soon, but don\u2019t have a maintenance plan to address the failure. I want to do those to avoid unplanned downtime, and be more proactive in my maintenance planning. The easiest way to do this is by using the work queue feature. Select Work queues tab on the Left Tab menu, and Show work queues. Work queues are preconfigured views designed to help you find what you're looking for...and to manage your day-to-day activities. These are particularly valuable to a Reliability Engineer who needs to address a specific problem, like a water treatment plant, trying to avoid unplanned downtime. In this exercise you will learn about the OOTB Health Work Queues. That allow you to focus on specific workflow tasks around identifying missing data so that you can calculated importment key performance metrics and then find assets in need of attention and actioning. Hover over the Missing Data Work Queue. There are a number of work queues included with Health and Predict. There are work queues specific to Predict, like assets with a High Probability of Failure . Hover over the Low Health Work Queue. There's also a work queue for identifying assets in poor health. Hover over the Missing Data Work Queue. And there are work queues that show assets with missing data. The Missing Data Work Queue are extremely useful to a reliability engineer as they can help identify gaps in data necessary to calculate health scores or predictive failure model. Hover over the Failing Before PM Work Queue. I can drill into the Failing Before PM work queue to see all of the assets with scores in that work queue. As a Reliability Engineer at a Water treatment plant, it is critical for me to avoid pump failures. Drill in to the Failing Before PM Work Queue. We can see that there are 4 pumps that have a predicted failure before their next planned maintenance date, and they are all non-OEM pumps. Note Recorded in a previous date. You can see the pump here, the one with the bad o-ring that our technician discovered. Select a different pump in the queue as we start to manage our workload for the day, investigating and addressing all of the assets in the queue. Asset Details You can understand more about the contributors to the asset Health Score and information about the asset. Click on pump 1 which opens the asset detail page [DETAILS ON THIS PAGE WILL VARY AS THIS IS A LIVE DEMO SYSTEM] The asset detail page is an incredibly useful tool for investigating assets. We can find all the asset information presented on a single page, in easy-to-read tables, charts and graphs. On the top of the page, I see details about my asset, and KPIs that give me a snapshot of its current state. For this asset, we have a health score of xx, which is in our yellow zone. We can also see that it has dropped xx points since it was last calculated Show health score and small number next to health score at the top. This asset also has a criticality and risk score. These too can be calculated in a similar manner to the Health Score. We can see this asset has xx% of its expected remaining useful life, based on the install date and manufacturers recommended life. Show 'RUL' card at the top. We can see that our asset is projected to fail in the next x days, but our next maintenance isn't planned for x days. Show 'Next Failure' card and 'Next PM' card at the top. When we started our investigation, we knew the asset was expected to fail before its planned maintenance. But, just by looking at the KPIs, we have additional evidence that this asset is in trouble, and that some action needs to be taken Below the KPI sections, we can see more information about our asset, which comes directly from our EAM system...in this case, Maximo Manage, also included with the Maximo Application Suite. Scroll to health details and click the arrows to show metrics. There's a breakdown of the health score drivers and factors that give us insight into what's causing its poor health. For this asset, and assets in the same group, we can see that the health score is a weighted average of open work orders, remaining useful life, and meter health. Predict Overview Scroll down from asset Health into the Predictions tab and open the tab. There are several predictive models built to score against incoming sensor data for our asset. IBM Predict includes templates to help our Data Scientist get started building models to project days to failure, calculate probability of failure, detect anomalies, and generate an asset life curve based on group asset deployment and retirement dates.\u202f These templates include a large number of algorithms and can automatically select the one that best fits our data for the optimal outcome. Note that also included with the Maximo Application Suite is Watson Studio and Watson Machine Learning, both of which our Data Scientist can use for building, training, and maintaining predictive models. Predicted Failure Model In the case of our asset, our model tells us that it is projected to fail in xx days...plus or minus xx days. Depending on the richness of our failure history, our Data Scientist can build predictive models for specific failure modes. And we can select those failure modes within the widget to see the projection for each. Select drop down arrow for failure mode. Click the info icon to learn more about the field. Also in the widget, we get information about our training data in the widget to help us decide when a model should be retrained. Review the Failure probability widget to learn about the different failure modes impact our predictions. For example, it might show us our asset has a xx% probability of failure in the next xx months due to xx Our Data Scientist can build specific models for time periods. And just like the failure modes, we can look at the results by making different selections within our widget. Review the Failure probability history widget. Failure probability history shows how the probability of failure for each mode has changed over time. Scroll to Factors that contribute to failures card. The factors that contribute to failure show which factors from our training data impacted failures the most, giving us an indication of what may lead to future failures. Scroll to Anomaly detection history card. Our anomaly detection model creates a threshold based on history, and we can see when our asset exceeds that threshold in our widget. Asset Timeline At the bottom of the page, is an asset timeline that shows us several pieces of key information about our asset in the same graph. Open Asset Timeline tab. For example, we can see that I have a predicted failure (on the top line of the graph), that will occur before our next planned maintenance (on the second line of the graph). Other information on the chart, like past work orders and inspection, provide valuable insight into our asset's history, and may support what kind of action we take. Hover over predicted failure. While each piece of information, or widget, gives us insight into the state of our asset, all of the information together, gives us a richer view, and helps us make a data-driven decision on how to address this asset. Take Action Scroll back to the top of the page and Select Action button in the right corner. Once I decide what action to take, I can do it immediately from the top of the asset detail page. Hover over the Create Service Request but don't click on it. I can create a service request , work order , recalculate a health score , or edit source asset record . Click on edit source record . In this case, I'll Edit the source asset record to adjust the next scheduled maintenance to avoid a potential failure...and unplanned downtime. Note Don't create or modify source record. Mark my asset addressed, and move to my next asset, confident that we'll avoid unplanned downtime at our water treatment plant. [DO NOT LEAVE THIS CHECKED] uncheck it. Summary As the Reliability Engineer, managing the short and long term asset planning for a water and waster water treatement facilities across multiple locations I was able to use IBM Maximo Health to: - Address short term asset needs by replacing a low-dollar o-ring could save thousands of dollars in capital costs preventing the pump from failing by vibrations. I can also use this this type of information on the Risk Matrix to ensure that we aren\u2019t over maintaining their assets in future years which I will cover in a separate exercise. Since we address all of the pumps in our work queue, we can reduce the alerts and SRs in Monitor. This information can also be valuable for capital planning purposes.","title":"6.

However, that automatic escalation will not include the job in the WO. For this section, you need to duplicate the template WO12345 against PMPDEVICE005 and Approve . You may wish to change the date to make your demo more realistic. WO12345 should be in canceled status in the Work Order Tracking app. Work Order Tracking In this exercise the supervisor plans work in Manage by duplicating and approving a work order. To find the work order: Go to Work Order Tracking in Manage. Go to More search fields using the vertical \u2026 menu. Clear the History? value, and click Find . Type 12345 in the Work Order field, and press enter. Open the work order by selecting 12345 from list. . From the left navigation bar, select Duplicate Work Order .

Manage - Mobile Technician that performs inspection and repair In this exercies you will be a Technician that performs inspection and repair using Manage, Maximo Mobile, and Assist. If you haven\u2019t downloaded the mobile application, this can be demonstrated using a desktop and logging into Manage. The TECHNICIAN application can be found in the Work Orders module, under the Role Based Applications sub-menu. From the browser settings select MORE TOOLS and RESPONSIVE design view or mode to have the screen appear more like a mobile device. Within Manage EAM, the newly created Service Request can be automated into a WO, tasks and labor are assigned and the status changed to approved. It is beneficial to have records processed without human intervention to increase the throughput rates and allow those resources to work on more value-add activities. In some cases a manual review by a supervisor may occur where they can drill into related history records against the PUMP, they can also link directly to the monitor dashboard to review the details of the anomaly/alert. Part of the evaluation may or may not give enough information to know exactly what needs to be addressed, so in this case an inspection should be performed.

The sedimentation tanks need to be constantly monitored for growth of fungi or other unwanted debris. The operator uses Maximo Visual Inspection to inspect the tanks. The cameras will be posted around the tanks for 24 hours a day, saving the operator time from checking the tanks every hour. Demo: I am an Asset Analyst at the facility and have been tasked to develop models that can identify dirty tanks. The developed models need to be highly accurate as they will be integrated into our Asset management solution using IBM Maximo. Create Dataset The Asset Analyst must create a dataset to aggregate images of the tank and label the data that represents dirty and clean tanks. First, we need to teach the model what it\u2019s looking for by uploading an image dataset and label or categorize the images in the dataset. The sample images can be found in the Box folder , but the dataset has already been loaded. Access Maximo Visual Inspection with the following URL Click on Get Started you should see the datasets page. In this demo, we will show you how to create a model to automatically inspect sedimentation tank cleanliness. We have pre-uploaded a dataset with images. Type tank in the search bar to filter for this dataset. Click on the Tank 1 Training IMAGE to open the dataset. Select Select Files then `Allv to select all images. Click Label then Objects . This is the training dataset to teach the model to recognize clean vs. dirty tanks. There may be multiple tanks in an image so we will create an object detection model where we can label multiple objects in an image. Images have already been labeled. Select a clean tank image from the images presented on the left. Select clean , select the draw box icon, and draw a box around portion of the image that denotes a clean tank . This will annotate images with portions that denotes a clean tank . Choose an image to see how to see label an object in the image. The labels clean and dirty have already been created as seen on the right side. If there was another label needed, you would click add label . Repeat labelling all the images with dirty and clean tanks Select dirty , or clean as needed, select Box and draw to draw a box around portion of the image that denotes the correct tank. Return to Tank 1 Training using the breadcrumbs. Select all the images and click Augment Data . You have now labeled 15 images (14 clean and 7 dirty). To train deep learning models of high accuracy, a dataset should have a variety and volume of images. MVI offers an ability to augment initial images by applying several filters. Select filters to Sharpen , Crop , Rotate , Vertical & Horizontal flips to generate 255 additional images. You can click cancel and navigate to the augmented dataset that is already created. Image augmentation prevents overfitting your model to the few images uploaded and can increase accuracy of the model. This feature lowers the cost of data acquisition and labelling for Asset Analysts. Please note, the annotations are also inherited on the augmented images. Navigate to the new dataset called Tank 1 Augmented \u2013 DO NOT DELETE and using the filter on objects, identify the 270 images, 252 labeled images with clean tanks and 126 images with dirty tanks. Your dataset may appear in a different order. Train Models We are ready to train a model. 1. Click the button labelled Train Model . 2. Select Object detection , make sure Faster R-CNN is selected. Normally you would click train model - a model is already created so show the model called DO NOT DELETE: OBJECT DETECTION MODEL FOR TANKS Note WARNING: If you click the button to Train model , it will take 30 minutes to complete the training. MVI offers several types of models required to address a use case. There is image classification to classify the whole image, object detection models to identify an object or objects within an image, and action detection models to detect an action. For this use case, there may be multiple tanks in the frame of reference so we have will train an object detection model. For the demo, show the pretrained model ALREADY in the demo system. Select Models from the left nav bar. Use the search bar to find the DO NOT DELETE: OBJECT DETECTION MODEL FOR TANKS model As an Asset Analyst, I can view the characteristics of the trained model. Click the trained model to view model metrics like Accuracy, mAP, Precision, Recall, IoU, Loss graphs and Confusion matrix. Validate the deployed model. Click the model from the deployment page.

Use the search bar to find the \u201cDO NOT DELETE: OBJECT DETECTION MODEL FOR TANKS\u201d model Access the validation images on the box folder Download an image from the clean folder. Drag and drop the image to validate. With validated model, you can build a dashboard in Maximo Monitor that will display the results of the tank inspections, from live camera feeds, as demonstrated in the Monitor section above. Deploy the models Now, I\u2019m going to turn it over to the Asset Manager who can deploy the models to run the automated visual inspections on MVI Edge. As the Asset Inspector at the facility and have been tasked to monitor the facility for dirty tanks. I have deployed the models from the MVI training server onto MVI Edge. MVI Edge is connected to multiple cameras inspecting tanks across the facility. From the MVI Edge dashboard, I can keep track of the real-time inspections and send a service request if needed. Setup Rules Access Maximo Visual Inspection Edge using URL using the log in information from your email. You will find the dashboard of all your inspections running on this MVI Edge . Click on Tank 1 Click on Configuration The project made in the MVI training server is deployed in MVI Edge with the dataset and model. Note Before giving the demo, check that there are images in the inspection results. If there are not then: 1. Disable inspection with the `Enabled` toggle. 2. Scroll down to `edit input source`. 3. Click the refresh icon next to `Processed`. 4. Then go back and toggle to Enable inspection with \u201cDisabled\u201d toggle. Scroll down to the Rules section. Click on the icon under Settings . Setup Alerts The asset inspector can create rules based off the inference results. In this case, if the inference result is a clean tank with a confidence score of greater than a .8 threshold then the asset inspector can mark the inference inspection as a pass. The other rule set the inspection as a fail when the model finds a dirty tank. Scroll down to view the Alert type . We can see that the asset inspector can send alerts via MQTT with the Maximo Monitor settings or via Twilio. We see here that the MQTT sent the inspection results to Maximo Monitor which we saw previously. Click Cancel to exit the pop-up. We can select our input source , connecting an image folder , video , or camera . In our case, we are connected to an image folder . Scroll back to the top and click on the \u201cImages\u201d tab to see the inspection results from the input source. Click on an image. Review Results We see here all the inference results from this input source. There is a green check mark for a pass and a red X for a failed dirty tank inspection. There may also be a yellow question mark if the model is unsure about the result. We also see the exclamation point in the triangle to indicate that the particular inspection result has been sent to Maximo Monitor via MQTT.

First, we need to teach the model what it\u2019s looking for by uploading an image dataset and label or categorize the images in the dataset. The sample images can be found in the Box folder , but the dataset has already been loaded. Access Maximo Visual Inspection with the following URL Click on Get Started you should see the datasets page. In this demo, we will show you how to create a model to automatically inspect sedimentation tank cleanliness. We have pre-uploaded a dataset with images. Type tank in the search bar to filter for this dataset. Click on the Tank 1 Training IMAGE to open the dataset. Select Select Files then `Allv to select all images. Click Label then Objects . This is the training dataset to teach the model to recognize clean vs. dirty tanks.

This will annotate images with portions that denotes a clean tank . Choose an image to see how to see label an object in the image. The labels clean and dirty have already been created as seen on the right side. If there was another label needed, you would click add label . Repeat labelling all the images with dirty and clean tanks Select dirty , or clean as needed, select Box and draw to draw a box around portion of the image that denotes the correct tank. Return to Tank 1 Training using the breadcrumbs. Select all the images and click Augment Data . You have now labeled 15 images (14 clean and 7 dirty). To train deep learning models of high accuracy, a dataset should have a variety and volume of images. MVI offers an ability to augment initial images by applying several filters. Select filters to Sharpen , Crop , Rotate , Vertical & Horizontal flips to generate 255 additional images. You can click cancel and navigate to the augmented dataset that is already created. Image augmentation prevents overfitting your model to the few images uploaded and can increase accuracy of the model.

Not all steps are complete or accurate. Asset Maintenance is an essential aspect of business operations, and it influences a significant part of operational expenses. Maintenance tasks may be preventive, predictive, or involve inspections to identify or monitor flaws. A preventive maintenance approach is often less selective and based on a fixed schedule as per industry best practices or the OEM. With the application of effective reliability strategies, these maintenance and inspection tasks can be more focused and centered around improving efficiency, reliability and safety of assets. RCM is an analysis-based approach which focuses on identifying asset functions, failure causes, failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA) for individual assets. RCM helps you prioritize, optimize and assign maintenance activities to increase asset life and decrease functional failure in the most cost-efficient way possible. Implementing RCM requires teams to perform RCM analysis for identifying critical asset functions, desired performance standards, possible failure scenarios, causes of those failure scenarios, and consequences of each failure scenarios for individual assets which requires significant time, cost and resources. A dedicated RCM / FMEA application which includes a reliability strategy library is available with Maximo Application Suite which makes it easy to select and apply reliability strategies for critical assets and speeds time to value. Available Asset Strategies As a reliability engineer for a water treatment plant, I want to implement RCM to improve asset availability and efficiency, and maintain my business-critical assets such as centrifugal pumps. I\u2019ve noticed that the lube oil tends to degrade over time. I want to put a strategy in place to regularly monitor the lube oil to prevent wear on the pump. In this exercise you will understand what asset classes and maintenance strategies are available in Maximo Reliability Strategies. Log into MAS and select the Manage with Health application. Navigate to Assets from left nav bar. Select Reliability Strategies to redirect to the Reliability Strategies application. The Reliability Strategy library accelerates application of RCM0with a list of 58,000+ failure modes and corresponding mitigation activities already defined for individual assets. I can use these to create preventive maintenance tasks and job plans. Click on the Asset box and a list of assets will be available for selection. Filter on Pump Asset Strategies With the MAS Reliability Strategies application, I have a prebuilt library of assets from which I can filter and select assets for RCM0analysis based on Asset type and Asset configuration to identify and select business critical assets. In this exercise you will understand what pump asset class maintenance strategies are available for preventive maintenance. Select Asset: Pump Select Asset type: Centrifugal Select Asset configuration: Pump - Horizontal - Multistage - Axially Split Case - Mechanical Seal - Radial Bearings-Oil Lubed (the 2nd one on the list). Select a Strategy This action returns failure modes and corresponding mitigation activities to get FMEA / PM and Job plans for selected asset from the library, which eliminates weeks of work to analyze RCM strategies with technicians, operators and supervisors and speeds up time to value. In this case, the Get strategy action provides a list of failure modes and corresponding mitigation activities for centrifugal pumps which I can analyze further to optimize our preventive maintenance tasks. Navigate to the Failure modes tab to see the list of all possible failure modes for centrifugal pumps. Expand Lube Oil to see corresponding failure mechanisms. Expand Degraded failure mechanism to see corresponding failure influences. Select Normal Wear failure influence. Select this as the Pump Asset Strategy Select a Operational Context What level of preventive maintenance is required depends on the utilization of the asset and it's location. This operational context is an important factor to consider in deciding on a preveventive maintenance plan. This helps me also identify the critical affects I should monitor for my asset. Stressors that can cause or worsen the failure, universal or conditional degradation time, failure effects, repair time as well as discovery opportunities to detect the functional failure. Select the pump operational context by scrolling to bottom right side of the page to see all the mitigation activities with its effectiveness listed for the Normal Wear for failure influence . Navigate to Mitigation activities tab. This will list all the mitigation activities for my asset.
