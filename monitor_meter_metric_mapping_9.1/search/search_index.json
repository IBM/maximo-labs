Attention This lab requires Maximo Application Suite 9.1 or later. MAS application entitlement must be Limited or higher. All Exercises All Exercises require that you have: A computer with a Chrome browser and internet connectivity. User access to a Maximo Application Suite 9.1 environment. Your Exercise facilitator should have provided you with the information on your access. An IBM ID. If you don't have an IBM ID you can get one here : o Click Login to MY IBM button o Click Create an IBM ID link Test your access to the Maximo Application Suite environment. Please complete the following exercises. Attention You should have the necessary permissions to view/create/edit/delete meter mappings. Exercise 1 - Add a meter to an Asset or Location in Maximo Manage Note To create Assets and Locations, refer to the step-by-step instructions in the Maximo Monitor Hierarchy Lab . Add a meter to an Asset Log in to MAS and navigate to Asset page ( Manage \u2192 Assets \u2192 Assets ) in Manage UI: Search for the Asset by name and click on it to view its meters. Click on the Meters tab. Click the Add Meter icon (\u2795 in a circle). Click the \u201c>\u201d icon in the Meter field and click on Select value from dropdown. Search for the meter by name and Select a meter from the meter table. Click the Save icon (\ud83d\udcbe) at the top. Verify the meter is added in the list. Add a meter to a Location Log in to MAS and navigate to Location page ( Manage \u2192 Assets \u2192 Locations ) in Manage UI: Search for the Location by name and click on it to view its meters. Refer to the Asset section above and continue from Step 3 to complete the process. Practice the process on your own. Exercise 2 - Create and Assign a Device with Metric Note Refer to the step-by-step instructions in the Device and Device type Setup Lab for this exercise. Create a device with metric in the Monitor UI. Turn on the data simulator for the device. Assign the device to the Location or Asset created in Exercise 1.
