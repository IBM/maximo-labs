Before you begin: This Exercise requires that you have: completed the pre-requisites required for all labs completed the previous exercises Since PLC's are very customizable you will need to add a new device to the Device library instead of using a pre-configured device in the Device library, like a Variable frequency Drive communicating over Modbus. Navigate to the Device library page: For OPC UA devices it is possible to either upload a device configuration or to use the built-in data tag auto-detection functionality which is a lot easier. Select Add device to library and the menu item Scan for devices : Select the OPC-UA protocol: Enter the device details and scroll down: Tip XX in the Device name should be your initials in case other people are following this lab in the same Maximo Application Suite environment.
