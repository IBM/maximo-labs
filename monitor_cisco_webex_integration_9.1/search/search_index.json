This will internally trigger the schedular to fetch Webex devices from Webex control hub. Tip It will take upto 15 minutes to fetch device list from Webex control hub. Once Webex devices are fetched from Webex control hub. We can Subscribe device using three dot in right side and It will add these webex devices in Device Type created by Cisco Webex integration. It will show status as Subscribed to those devices which we subscribed in above step. Note The name of device type will be same as Integration name(mentioned in Cisco Webex integration configuration). This is automatically handled by Monitor. To check Devices in device type expand Setup under the Monitor setup section in the left menu and select Device types : Search for Cisco Webex in device types and select the Cisco_Webex : Once these devices are subscribed, we will be able to get the people presence count in the Metrics.

They are often overused or underused which can lead to productivity loss. Some rooms could be divided, while others should be augmented. Space optimization has a direct impact on energy and the cost of real estate, but more importantly on employees productivity and wellbeing. Webex Devices provide us with People count that uses IOT sensors and AI to accurately detect humans, whether they are facing the Webex Device or not. This data makes it easy to plan and optimise spaces based on usage trends. Purpose of Cisco Webex Integration in Monitor MAS Monitor is designed to offer comprehensive real-time visibility and monitoring of critical infrastructure and assets. This real-time data collection enables businesses to monitor performance, detect anomalies, and respond promptly to any issues that may arise. By integrating Cisco Webex devices, Monitor enhances its capabilities, in terms of real-time people presence count and usage analytics. Cisco Webex devices are leveraged to track people presence in specific locations. These devices provide accurate counts of individuals in meeting rooms, offices, or other designated areas in real time. This people presence data is invaluable for several reasons: Space Utilization: By understanding how spaces are used, organizations can optimize their layouts, ensuring that rooms and areas are appropriately sized and equipped for their actual usage. Resource Allocation: Real-time presence data helps in allocating resources more effectively. For instance, cleaning schedules can be adjusted based on actual room usage rather than fixed schedules.","title":"1.
