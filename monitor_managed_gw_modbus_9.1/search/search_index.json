Before you begin: This Exercise requires that you have: completed the pre-requisites required for all labs completed the previous exercises Please find the IP address of the machine the Modbus simulator is running on. I was running the simulator on my local network on a machine with the IP address: 192.168.1.64. While looking at your Managed Gateway in the Gateways list, press the Add device : The Use device library will automatically be selected, as a Managed Gateway only supports devices from the library. Simply click on Continue : Note The type of gateway defines which types of devices that can be added to the gateway. This is automatically handled by Monitor. Managed Gateway: OT devices from the device library. Standard/Privileged Gateway: IoT devices are added as custom devices. It is time to add the Lenze i550 device. Search for Lenze in the manufacurer drop-down and select it. Click Next : Select the i550 product and click on Next : Select the Modbus TCP protocol. Click on Next : Tip The simulator only supports the Modbus TCP protocol, so it will fail if you select another protocol. Now it is time to use the IP address of the simulator and combine it with port number 10502 separated by : , like 192.168.1.64:10502 . Click on Next ; Tip Do not change the Server or unit ID as the simulator does not support it. Define the Device ID as XX_Lenze_i550_01 where you replace XX with your initials. You can see the Product Type of the industrial device you have chosen, i.e. Variable Frequency Drives for the Lenze i550. Click on the Device type and you should see this: You will create your own Device Type. Since you have not yet done so, you just type XX_VFD where you replace XX with your initials: Click on the new device type to create it and click Next : Tip You can select your own Device Type from the drop-down list once you have created it. Define the Data frequency to 60000 (60 seconds) and it will automatically be used when you select the metrics: Select all the Standard Metrics and one additional Synthesised Metric. Click Save : Tip Standard metrics use labels, units, and values that are unified by the Managed Gateway once deployed. Synthesized metrics are created by using other metrics. Some standard metrics are synthesized, but those metrics are only listed as standard metrics. You have now successfully added the first OT device to your Managed Gateway: Congratulations you have successfully added an industrial device to a Managed Gateway.","title":"3.
