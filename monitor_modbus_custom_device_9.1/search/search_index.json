Before you begin: This Exercise requires that you have: completed the pre-requisites required for all labs completed the previous exercises New in MAS 9.1 You can add custom devices, such as PLCs or OPC-UA servers, or industrial devices which supports Modbus, BACnet and Json protocols that are not available in the Maximo Monitor Device library. Later the same device can be used by anyone who is creating a device on the Devices page. Assuming the Lenze i550 VFD device is not in the pre-configured library, you can add this device to the Device library by uploading the CSV file in given format.

It is important to note that each row in the CSV represents a single Modbus datapoint. Modbus datapoint details can be found in the Manufacturer user manual/Communication manual.

Actual Torque - 42013 Name The name of the data point should be added in this column. The value will be used in Monitor as the related metric name. Actual Torque Type Supported formats uint , sint , float , string and bool . The data type of a datapoint is determined by the physical property it represents and the range of values expected. For instance, if a value like frequency, Torque never goes negative, it's categorized as an unsigned integer (uint). Manuals may explicitly label it as \"uint\". If the data can include negative values, it's treated as a signed integer (int or sint), and is often directly mentioned in the documentation. Floating point numbers (float) are typically specified as such in the manual and are used for properties requiring decimal precision. Strings are made up of characters packed in 16-bit unsigned integers, and may be referred to as \"ascii\" or \"char\" in device documentation. Coil addresses represent Boolean values, storing simple binary data (0 or 1). Length 1 byte = 8 bits 2 byte = 16 bits = 1 word (42013) 4 byte = 32 bits = 2 words (42025 + 42026) 12 byte = 96 bits = 6 words (30008 to 30013) Unit This column indicates the unit in which the data is reported for a specific datapoint. This is an optional parameter as not all datapoints require a unit. Multiplier Used to get the exact values from the raw values In the example for Acutal torque it is x.x % as defined, so the multiplier is 0.1 . Not applicable for float, string, bool data types. Function Code[FC] Function codes are usually decided based on the starting number of register number (old Modicon notation). In the example, 4xxxx and 3xxxx registers mean Holding registers[FC3] and Input registers[FC4] respectively. Register_Offset In the example, register offset is required the address 0 is used in the frame. when register 40001 is read. The register offset is the amount that needs to be added to the Register address to obtain the real Modbus Decimal address. Since the register is in the FC format (i.e. 42013), we have added -40001 offset. If the register address was 4097, offset would need to be just -1 For filling the metrics sheet, please refer Sample Metrics Format sheet. Note Once the required datapoint details is filled to the Metrics sheet, kindly save the Excel file Metrics as CSV format for uploading. Upload the CSV file and select Next You can see the summary of datapoints, if required you can remove the metrics here. Once done click Finish : Attention If you see a Bad Request error while Uploading the CSV file, then you might need to check the CSV file for each metrics which you might be missing details or it maybe in a invalid format.
