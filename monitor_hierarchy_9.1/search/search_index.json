Organization activation now requires cost-centre details to be entered in Manage, ensuring financial alignment and accountability from the outset. Once organizations are activated in Manage, they automatically appear in Monitor under the Hierarchy section, reflecting their structure and relationships. All hierarchy levels including Location, System, Asset, Site, and Organization are created and managed within Manage, centralizing control and consistency.

You can use systems to categorize the use or physical qualities of locations and to build a hierarchy of locations within a site. For example, a system can represent a group of buildings at a site or even the whole site. A site can have multiple systems, but one system in the site must be designated as the primary system. The first system that is associated with a site is automatically the primary system, but you can designate a different system as the primary system if necessary. The primary system must be hierarchical, meaning that there is a parent-child relationship between each location in the system. In the Manage Assets Work Center, select the Places(Location/Asset) page. Select the Manage Systems tab and select Add system. Enter a system name, description and save the record. Optional: To make the system that you added the primary system for the site, edit the row for that system and specify Y in the Primary System column.","title":"Objectives"},{"location":"create_system/#objectives","text":"In this Exercise you will learn how to: Create System Before you begin: This Exercise requires that you have: completed the pre-requisites required for all labs completed the previous exercises Info A system is a group of locations that is organized into a logical hierarchy of parent and child locations to help you track assets and manage work more effectively.
