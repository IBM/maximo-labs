These heat maps help visualize user movement patterns on a floor using coordinate-based data ( x_pos and y_pos ). We\u2019ll walk through the full process including verifying floor plans, creating calculated metrics, and rendering heat maps on a custom dashboard. Overview Cisco Spaces sends real-time user location events which include X and Y positions. Using this data, we can: Plot heat maps on SVG-based floor plans. Observe occupancy trends. Analyze behavior across time (hourly, daily, etc.). Step-by-Step Guide to Generate Heat Maps Step 1: Verify Floor Plan for the MREF Floor Go to Dashboard \u2192 Location View . Use the search bar to find the desired Floor Name . Click on the floor to open dashboards. On the right-side pane, select the Workplace Analytics tab. Ensure that a floor plan (.svg) has been generated from MREF. Step 2: Create Occupancy Location Calculated Metric We now create a calculated metric to capture occupancy data over time. Navigate back to the Locations tab. Open the Calculated Metrics tab. Click Add Calculated Metric . Configure the Metric: This will open a pop-up with the list of function to calculate the batch data metrics From this popup, search and select : OccupancyLocation aggregate function. Fill in the configuration fields: Scope : Define the nodes to include. Input : Select x_pos and y_pos metrics from the dropdown.
